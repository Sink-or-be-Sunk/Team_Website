            <h2>Progress Report for Joe Mislansky-</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 8/27/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Joe worked on the final project proposal. Meeting with the team as well as course instructors, the PSSCs were finalized and a couple backup PSSCs were determined. </br>

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/3/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            This week, Joe worked on the functional specification document. Specifically, research was done into the economic constraints of the project as well as any other existing options. The only existing electronic version of Hasbro's <i>Battleship</i> is
			a version that has light and sound effects. Otherwise, Hasbro's game does not have any other electronic capabilities such as the ability to connect to the internet. There are other board games that currently exist on the market, however, they mainly communicate with a server to keep track of points or make movements, as 
			opposed to communicating with other board game sets. The design of this team is best compared to bringing an online multiplayer game to life.</br> </br>
			
			Joe did research into the possibility of using LED strips as opposed to individual LEDs. An online <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/guide-for-ws2812b-addressable-rgb-led-strip-with-arduino/">guide</a> went into detail about how to use digital LEDs in which a chip controls each individual LED. This is known as addressable LEDs. However, most examples required the use of an Arduino. </br></br>

			Joe also spent time learning about KiCad and PCB development. As he has never worked with PCB or soldering before, he is excited to learn a new skill in the physical side of the computer engineering world as he has traditionally worked with the virtual side in programming. He is currently working on the KiCad tutorial that was provided by the course staff on YouTube. This project is learning how to make a custom name tag with blinking lights. Lastly, Joe got out his breadboard and was began to go through lab and homework files from ECE 362 to brush up on some of the skills learned over a year ago. </br>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/10/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            During Week 3, I did more research into the specific types of LED chips and how to implement them. Some online libraries were found such as FastLED that were used to control the LEDs. Specific strips were ordered with teh WS2182B chips so that testing with the ESP32 could be done as soon as they came in. <br> <br>
			
			Also, I began working with the ESP32 development kit, specifically the ESP32 WROOM 32. I began with trying to get the ESP32 development environment set up in Eclipse as that was the software I had experience doing C development on a microcontroller with in ECE 362. I was able to compile the code anf flash it to the devboard, however, I was unable to get the serial monitor to work correctly.
			Later that day I tried to setup Visual Studio Code as my environment and this was significantly easier. I was able to get a Hello World program running on the device and was able to see that output successfully on the serial monitor. My next step is to use the buttons on a number pad to control an LCD display. <br> <br>

			Lastly, I continued working through the KiCad tutorial. Not as much time was spent on this as hoped, but over the weekend he plans to get through the rest of the YouTube tutorial series.  </br> <br>

            <h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/17/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 3 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week I finished up the KiCad tutorial and would like to begin practicing soldering next week. The picture included below is the footprint editor for a custom part as shown in the video tutorial. We are going to have a significant number of LEDs that we have to solder onto our final PCB and I know that is going to take a long amount of time. <br> <br>

			<img src="Team/progress/img/mislansky_wk4.png" width="300" height="300"></img> <br> <br>

			I also worked more with the ESP32 and got an LED to light up. I spent time reading through old 362 lectures to review how to work with the microcontrollers and using GPIO input/outputs. This week I did not do nearly as much work as I would've liked due to career fair work and getting over a cold through multiple days. <br>
            
			<h4>Week 5:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/24/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

			This week I spend a significant amount of time learning how to use CAD software. I began with Autodesk AutoCAD, but after a couple hours of watching tutorials and playing with it, it still seemed very unintuitive. Then I remember that I had used AutoDesk Fusion 360 before so I redownloaded that software and began to work with that.
			After many hours of YouTube videos and trial and error, I was able to put together a rough sketch of a possible mechanical visualization of our product. One issue that we are going to have to deal with is the placement of the LEDs with respect to the pinholes for the boats. Because we want the LEDs to stil be able to shine through, we need to test what distance 
			we need the hole and LED to be separate so that it won't get blocked by the pins but still be close enough to the hole so it looks like it's almost the same spot. Another issue will be determining exactly where we ant all the peripherals to go. The 4x4 keypad is what we are considering, however, if we use a 4x2 or 8x1 keypad we would be able to use less pins while
			still maintaining functionality. The eight buttons would represent a letter and a number as opposed to 16 buttons representing the numbers and letters individually. The LCD would work best on the bottom
			to keep the balance good, however, it seems more practical to put it on the top for readability. The dial and speaker do not matter as much in terms of location. <br> <br>

			In the drawing I included, the bottom has the LEDs and the holes as well as the LCD and the and the speaker dial. The top has LEDs, keyboard matrix, and speaker. What isn't shown is the battery and rumble motor which would be included underneath the PCB board on the bottom board. <br> <br>

			<h4>Week 6:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 10/1/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

			This week I spent time working on our webpage and doing some research into a better CSS to use. The webpage template is kind of blocky and dry and I think it would look better if we did a more modern feel or some sort of wartime theme. I started by making sure we had all our components and other documents uploaded to the site so that everything would be up to date and I played around with the image carousel. Now that I know how it works, I’m going to upload pictures of our prototypes so it can more accurately reflect our work. <br><br>

			I had to spend sometime learning how to use CSS and using Bootstrap, I was able to begin working on a new navigation bar and background for the website. I think the floating text over the background has a much better look to it. In the future, I want to work with the fonts and organizational layouts of the progress reports and the documents page. The one on the current website seems very clunky. <br> <br>
			
			I also began reviewing our software in preparation for the software formalization. I spent time with my teammates discussing how they’ve implemented software as well as how that will interface with the hardware. While the software is not completely done, I also discussed what we still need to work on and add to our code in the coming weeks. <br><br>

			<h4>Week 7:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 10/8/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

			This week I spent time working on the Software Formalization as well as the Midterm Design Review. <br> <br>

			Working on the software formalization was harder than anticipated because while we have a decent generalization of how our code is going to work, we haven't necessarily defined functions for everything yet. I read through the code on our GitHub and reviewed other teammates progress reports to get a better understand of what code we had already written, but then I had to determine what functionality we still needed to implement. I started working on a framework for the messages that the server will need to send to the board. This includes information such as verifying attack location, the outcome of the attack, the current board state, and if audio or rumble is needed. Since we're using JSON this could be done a couple ways. It could be as simple as a string of information that gets sent and the ESP32 would know exactly which characters do what or it could require a little more computation but make it more readable. I think making the JSON more readable would be more beneficial to the team. An example JSON entry is shown in one of the screenshots below. 
			In this example, the JSON data represents what the board would receive after an opponent has attacked. The bottom_state and top_state represent the current state of the hits/misses on the board. This will be used to signify which LEDs need to be on and what color they should be. 0 represents off, 1 represents miss (white), and 2 represnts hit (red). The other values in the data would tell the board what sound to play, what kind of rumble for the motor, and whether or not a ship has been sunk.<br><br>

			I also worked on the midterm design review. I created a Gantt chart for the rest of our project and tried to set some soft deadlines of when we want to get tasks completed with the help of one of my teammates. This required doing some preliminary research on shipping times for PCBs from different companies.<br><br>

			<h4>Week 9:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 10/22/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

			This week I spent time working on the development of the webpage for users' to play our game online against someone with a board. <br> <br>

			I've done some HTML and JavaScript before, but it had been awhile so I spent a few hours just looking over past work and W3Schools tutorials. I wanted to create both of the grids. This involved creating an attack board which means the user needs to see if they are getting hits or misses as well as a placement board where the user can put their own pieces.
			My teammate Mitch found some good starter <a href src="https://codepen.io/osublake/pen/b46392f9d230db0521502815ae836106">code</a> on creating a board and draggable options. With more research I learned how to use the library <a href="https://shopify.github.io/draggable/">Draggable</a>. Using the example code I was able to implement multiple boats with rotations on click and moving on drag. 
			Then I worked on the attack board which was relatively easy. I generate the board and gave each cell an ID from 0 to 63. Then if the user clicked on one it changed the class from clear to hit or miss using a lookup table of what the opponents board was. Eventually all of this will have to send and receive data from the server instead of locally, but I wanted to get the UI done first. <br> <br>

			While this was from last week, I still wanted to include it. I spent time on a CAD drawing of our project for our Midterm Design Review and it came out really well. This is a fairly accurate depiction of what our final design should look like.<br><br>

			<h4>Week 10:</h4>

            <b>Total hours:</b> 5 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

			This week I continued working on development of the UI for the website for the user to play Sink or be Sunk online. 

			I first spent time developing HTML user templates for different actions on the webpage. The templates I made were account creation successful, reset password, reset password confirmation, game invite, winning message, and losing message. These email templates were created through beefree.io and then downloaded and edited. I've included an example below. The code is <a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0b2vqmi3HXUeVmKBZUDR18PlA#welcome">here</a>.<br> <br>

			<img src="Team/progress/img/mislansky_wk10.png" width="400" height="300"></img> <br> <br>

			After that I found a javascript library that allows you to send emails. This is called EmailJS. You upload email templates to their website and can allow for parameters within that template. I created a function within my existing code that would send the email. While I don't have access to the database currently, it would be easy enough to call from the database to pull the data needed to send the email. I hard coded in the usernames and scores for the parameters. Once the game was completed, it sent an email to myself saying that I won. This can be seen in the GIF below.

			<h4>Week 11:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 11/5/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

			This week I wanted to finish the boat setting portion of the online version of our game as well as the actual attacks. While I did not get to the attacks by Friday, I plan on finishing that over the weekend. The biggest issue that I was having was that boats were allowed to overlap as well as when you rotated them sometimes they would go outside the grid. At first I tried to make it so these things would be avoidable from the user interacting with them but I couldn't find an easy solution with the existing library I was using. I didn't want to rewrite all of my code so I decided to add error detection upon confirmation.
			This was difficult at first because I had to figure out how to pull the correct information from the objects as they were not typical CSS values. I also ran into a weird problem (that I think had to do with objects being initialized in the DOM) in which the height and width of the boats were not showing up. I found a different way to access these values through JQuery which made my life a lot easier. The boat placements is now totally complete because the user cannot place boats on top of each other and it packages the data to send to the server. Once I am totally finished with this portion I will work with Mitch to
			send the data correctly. My next steps are to show attacks from the other user, send attacks correctly from yourself, and spend more time on the actual visuals so we have boats instead of colored blocks.

			<img src="Team/progress/img/mislansky_wk11.gif"></img> <br> <br>

			Lastly, in lab I started working on assembling the grid PCBs and will help the team finish those hopefully early next week. I helped with attaching the LEDs, resistors, and capacitors with solder paste so that it could be putt in the oven. We still need to add the actual connectors for the boats and we will work on that next week. 

			<h4>Week 12:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 11/12/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

			This week I was in charge of the homework so I spent a good portion of my time researching the environmental and ethical concerns of our project. On top of that, I worked on soldering the grid PCB boards. We are close to being finished with the LED portion of the boards and will need to work on the boat connectors. This will require us to break down the header pins and sand them. I need to obtain the materials from a teammate, but plan to break apart and sand this weekend so we can solder them next week. <br><br>

			I also essentially finished up the online version of SInk or be Sunk. Or at least as much as I can do without understanding the server code better. I added conditionals to make sure it was the correct users turn as well as to confirm that the user had sent over their boat locations. I also wrote skeleton code to be able to parse the attacks from the other user and update the board on your own view. Again, I will need to understand the server code better and talk with Mitch on what sending and receiving information from the server looks like. I would like to work on visual changes as well to the website, however, this is a low priority right now as this is just a demo and not a final product yet. My goals would be to add imagery that makes the boats look like actual boats, make the hits/misses look better than a opaque colored block, and improve the surrounding and background imagery. <br><br>

			Visually, I don't have a ton to show this week that is different from last week. However, in my code you can see the skeleton code and the updates for checking if it is the user's turn or not. It is just a simple flag that I've used. <br><br>

			<h4>Week 13:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 11/19/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

			This week I finished up the construction of all of the LEDs on the grid boards. This was basically work as I had done in the previous weeks so I do not have a lot to update there. To go in more detail, I began by setting up my station by taping down a guard and a grid board. Then I lined up the stencil over it and taped that down as well. Next, using SAC305 solder paste, I scraped an even layer of solder across the holes in the stencil. After removing the stencil, I then placed the LEDs, capacitors, and resistors. Finally, after making three or four boards, I put them in the oven and baked them on wave 3. After they cooled I would scrape the excess solder off and inspect for any issues that would need to be fixed through soldering. The images below show one completed LED board as well as all of the assorted completed boards.<br><br>
			
			I was going to show off my web version of our game as our "Show me a thing", however, it was not necessary this week. My teammate that wrote most of the server code was preoccupied with debugging the ESP32 board this week, however, I was able to look through his code and apply some of it to mine. There are still a couple of integrations I'm not sure how to do, such as implement the CSS I wrote within his file structure and receive user attacks, but otherwise I was able to implement most things. <br><br>

			This week I was out of town for most of the Thanksgiving holiday break, however, I began work on the Senior Design Semester Report from home. This is one of our final project deliverables and represents a summary and description of the entire project and the efforts of the team throughout the semester. I hope to finish this up on Monday/Tuesday and use the rest of my time to work the team on assembling our board. Most everything is coming together, we just have to work through the main PCB difficulties. It is also becoming time to work on the final project presentation powerpoint and that is something I also hope to work on this coming week. <br> <br>

			During the week, it was all hands on deck for working on the project. We have a lot of little things that still need to be done so everyone is basically working on everything. While Mitch is working on finishing up the code for the micro, Molly, Garrett, and I spent time constructing various parts of the project. This week I worked on testing LED boards and installing them in the physical board. We had gotten the acrylic cut and holes drilled through it, so I had to screw in all of the individual PCBs. While obviously not hard, it was a little time consuming to do this. While doing that, I was also testing other grid boards that Molly was touching up with solder. This weekend I plan on going into lab to work on installing more components on the board.<br><br>

			We did it! With all odds against us, we finished the project in time for the Spark challenge, completed all PSSCs, and had a final packaging that looked really good. This week was truly a huge effort by every team member to get everything done. My time was spent on testing, packaging, and making presentations. Early in the week I was testing grid boards to make sure they were detecting boats successfully. That involved hooking an oscilloscope up to the output of a board and shorting each spot one at a time. We were having issues with the boat detection but eventually figured out it was more of a software issue than a hardware issue. Most of my time was spent towards cleaning up wiring and packaging. We had many connections for our boards so the amount of wiring for the PCBs was a lot. We went through multiple iterations of ideas but eventually were able to hide wires under the boards as shown in one of the pictures below. <br><br>

			On Thursday we installed the rest of our packaging to clean up the board. Another teammate cut a piece of wood to cover up the rest of our wires that we couldn't hide, and I helped install that. It was super important to get this piece in successfully as it cleaned up our board really well. <br><br>
			<img src = "Team/progress/img/mislansky_wk16_final.jpeg" width="400"></img> <br> <br>

			Finally, I spent time editing the video for the Spark challenge, making the voice over, and helping with the poster. We presented today and it was a lot of fun seeing people play with our project. We even made it to the second round of judging. We did have one major issue today though, and that was the power connection. The micro USB port was not soldered correctly and it started to fall off its pads during the day. We had to use a lot of electrical tape to get it to work, but eventually we fixed it. At least temporarily. <br><br>
