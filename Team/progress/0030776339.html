This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Progress Report for Joe Mislansky-</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 8/27/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Joe worked on the final project proposal. Meeting with the team as well as course instructors, the PSSCs were finalized and a couple backup PSSCs were determined. </br>

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/3/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            This week, Joe worked on the functional specification document. Specifically, research was done into the economic constraints of the project as well as any other existing options. The only existing electronic version of Hasbro's <i>Battleship</i> is
			a version that has light and sound effects. Otherwise, Hasbro's game does not have any other electronic capabilities such as the ability to connect to the internet. There are other board games that currently exist on the market, however, they mainly communicate with a server to keep track of points or make movements, as 
			opposed to communicating with other board game sets. The design of this team is best compared to bringing an online multiplayer game to life.</br> </br>
			
			Joe did research into the possibility of using LED strips as opposed to individual LEDs. An online <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/guide-for-ws2812b-addressable-rgb-led-strip-with-arduino/">guide</a> went into detail about how to use digital LEDs in which a chip controls each individual LED. This is known as addressable LEDs. However, most examples required the use of an Arduino. </br></br>

			Joe also spent time learning about KiCad and PCB development. As he has never worked with PCB or soldering before, he is excited to learn a new skill in the physical side of the computer engineering world as he has traditionally worked with the virtual side in programming. He is currently working on the KiCad tutorial that was provided by the course staff on YouTube. This project is learning how to make a custom name tag with blinking lights. Lastly, Joe got out his breadboard and was began to go through lab and homework files from ECE 362 to brush up on some of the skills learned over a year ago. </br>
