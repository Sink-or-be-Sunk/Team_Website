            <h2>Progress Report for Joe Mislansky-</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 8/27/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Joe worked on the final project proposal. Meeting with the team as well as course instructors, the PSSCs were finalized and a couple backup PSSCs were determined. </br>

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/3/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            This week, Joe worked on the functional specification document. Specifically, research was done into the economic constraints of the project as well as any other existing options. The only existing electronic version of Hasbro's <i>Battleship</i> is
			a version that has light and sound effects. Otherwise, Hasbro's game does not have any other electronic capabilities such as the ability to connect to the internet. There are other board games that currently exist on the market, however, they mainly communicate with a server to keep track of points or make movements, as 
			opposed to communicating with other board game sets. The design of this team is best compared to bringing an online multiplayer game to life.</br> </br>
			
			Joe did research into the possibility of using LED strips as opposed to individual LEDs. An online <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/guide-for-ws2812b-addressable-rgb-led-strip-with-arduino/">guide</a> went into detail about how to use digital LEDs in which a chip controls each individual LED. This is known as addressable LEDs. However, most examples required the use of an Arduino. </br></br>

			Joe also spent time learning about KiCad and PCB development. As he has never worked with PCB or soldering before, he is excited to learn a new skill in the physical side of the computer engineering world as he has traditionally worked with the virtual side in programming. He is currently working on the KiCad tutorial that was provided by the course staff on YouTube. This project is learning how to make a custom name tag with blinking lights. Lastly, Joe got out his breadboard and was began to go through lab and homework files from ECE 362 to brush up on some of the skills learned over a year ago. </br>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/10/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            During Week 3, I did more research into the specific types of LED chips and how to implement them. Some online libraries were found such as FastLED that were used to control the LEDs. Specific strips were ordered with teh WS2182B chips so that testing with the ESP32 could be done as soon as they came in. <br> <br>
			
			Also, I began working with the ESP32 development kit, specifically the ESP32 WROOM 32. I began with trying to get the ESP32 development environment set up in Eclipse as that was the software I had experience doing C development on a microcontroller with in ECE 362. I was able to compile the code anf flash it to the devboard, however, I was unable to get the serial monitor to work correctly.
			Later that day I tried to setup Visual Studio Code as my environment and this was significantly easier. I was able to get a Hello World program running on the device and was able to see that output successfully on the serial monitor. My next step is to use the buttons on a number pad to control an LCD display. <br> <br>

			Lastly, I continued working through the KiCad tutorial. Not as much time was spent on this as hoped, but over the weekend he plans to get through the rest of the YouTube tutorial series.  </br> <br>

            <h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/17/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 3 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week I finished up the KiCad tutorial and would like to begin practicing soldering next week. The picture included below is the footprint editor for a custom part as shown in the video tutorial. We are going to have a significant number of LEDs that we have to solder onto our final PCB and I know that is going to take a long amount of time. <br> <br>

			I also worked more with the ESP32 and got an LED to light up. I spent time reading through old 362 lectures to review how to work with the microcontrollers and using GPIO input/outputs. This week I did not do nearly as much work as I would've liked due to career fair work and getting over a cold through multiple days. <br>
