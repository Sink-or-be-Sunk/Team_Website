				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				Throughout Week 1 of the Sink or be Sunk project, our team was primarily focused on completing the Final Design Proposal document and continuing to build upon and solidify concepts for functionality. During this time, I contributed to the brainstorm for coordinate detection methods and additional sensory elements (such as sound and vibration). By using an online Word document, the sections of the proposal were easily divided; I was responsible for updating the overall project description, which was mostly carry-over from my portion in the Initial Project Proposal. For this, I made slight changes to the solution based on feedback from Todd and discussion from the team. In doing so, the team has a more unified understanding of the high-level project goals. To further support this, I assisted in the creation of our PSSCs by highlighting the most significant elements of our project (such as ship detection and WiFi connection). From Week 1, I learned about the ESP32 capabilities through our discussions of different microcontrollers and their capabilities. I also learned a substantial amount from Mitch, particularly about Websockets and WiFi connectivity. Going forward, I will need to place an emphasis on the physical layout of the ship-placing board and look into battery management systems, in order to begin planning for our PCBs.<br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				In the beginning of this week, I began investigating Battery Management Systems (BMS). Since this is my first time working with one, I watched online tutorials and read explanations to get a higher understanding of their capabilities. In doing so, I learned about the variety of BMS add-ons – such as having both charging and discharging capabilities and indicators, and end of life indicators based on charge ratios. While this is still my first time with these systems, with a lot left to learn, this helped me become more comfortable discussing our options with the team. Going forward, I will continue looking into different types of boards and help the team identify which BMS boards are most suitable for our project.</br></br>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/bms_notes.jpg" width="300" height="400"></img></p>

				In addition to this, I met with Mitch to further discuss his concept for ship detection. Since I am taking on the role as hardware engineer, it is critical I have a sound understanding on the electrical components of the project. I had some confusion regarding the ADC checking over the various pegs and voltage dividers, however Mitch provided a breadboard example and further explained how the pegs will be multiplexed into just a few channels. From here, I felt more comfortable with the overall idea, and eager to begin testing. I ordered our first round of parts (12 Analog Multiplexers - Texas Instruments/SN74LV4051AN). Once the parts arrive, I will be able to begin testing by simulating just a couple “rows” from the ship-detection board. To prepare for testing, I took a Digital Multiplexer and did some minor testing to refresh my understanding of 8:1 multiplexing and their select line logic. Now, when the parts arrive sometime next week, I will feel more suitable for testing and circuit assembly. During this time, I learned about the difference between analog and digital multiplexing, and more specifically how digital signals are discretized, which could cause some unpredictable results in multiplexing. </br></br>

				Throughout this week, our team was tasked with completing the Functional Specification document; I was responsible for completing the Other Constraints portion. For this portion, I highlighted elements of our game that fall outside the typical Mechanical, Electronic, and Economic constraints. This narrowed my focus on user interfacing. I brainstormed high-level constraint ideas with the team, some of which were later applied in the other constraint categories. From there, I further explained these constraints and provided evidence towards a potential health hazard of too much LED exposure on the eyes. Going forward, it is critical for our team to consider these constraints in order to optimize gameplay engagement for our targeted audience. From our Functional Specification document, I learned more about the arrangement of the ESP32 channels, particularly because I was also working to better understand the constraints of multiplexing our boat pegs into a suitable number of signals for the ADC. Further, this helped me understand the pin constraints of the ESP32; in the future we will need to identify how many of the channels on the ESP32 can be saved for the ship detection based on how many pins we will need for GPIO, PWM, DAC, and so on. Looking ahead, the goals for next week will be to further my understanding of KiCad by watching tutorials and creating simple schematics. This will be beneficial during PCB planning. <br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				In the beginning of this week, the analog multiplexers I ordered arrived and I was able to jump into testing. Initially, I tested the functionality of the device by placing only one voltage dividers to the Y0 pin and grounding the three select lines. This not only assured me of the functionality of the chip, but also demonstrated the accuracy of the chip (which was within 15% of the expected output). From here, I continued testing by migrating the voltage divider to the other output pins and manipulating the select line values. One of my concerns about the analog multiplexers was going to be the precision required for the select lines; upon further review and testing the select line, 70% of the Vcc value and above is identifies as “High”, and 30% of Vcc and lower identifies as “low”. This provides more flexibility than I had predicted and will become extremely beneficial when progressing to debugging stages, as we will be able to adjust the supply voltages with resistors to fit according. Once I had a solidified understanding of the singular analog multiplexer, I added a secondary multiplexer to imitate a second row on the player’s ship-placing board. Moreover, taking this extra step helped me visualize the layout of the final game board. Overall, it was critical to have a sound understanding of the analog multiplexers, their capabilities, and their constraints. As we progress into the next steps of circuitry and PCB design, our team will be able to better predict the functionality of the multiplexers, and thus the overall ship detection aspect of our game. </br></br>

				This week I 3D printed a prototype destroyer boat (from a free .stl file found online). Ultimately, this was to help our team visualize the sizing constraints for each of the pegs. After printing, we realized that we may need some type of flat panel on the bottom to evenly attach the voltage dividers. Moreover, one of the biggest challenges of this project will be finding a method of connecting the voltage dividers (inside of the boats) to the circuitry beneath the board, while still having room for the LEDs beneath to shine through. Throughout the week I brainstormed different methods of housing the voltage dividers in the bottom of the boat to electrically connect to the attack board. One idea I had was to open a push button and use the housing unit to store a soldered voltage divider. This was successful in that it just barely fit two resistors but had shortcomings in terms of supply power and ground and blocking the LED from shining through the boat. Next week, I plan to attempt to create a PCB (From the Advanced Manufacturing Team in the ECE Shop) with just a simple voltage divider and a hole in the middle for the LED beneath to shine through. If this is successful, there will be a standardized size for each of the pegs and a more organized method of placing the boats into the attack board.<br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/boat2.jpg" width="600" height="400"></img></p>
				
				In order to complete Homework 4 – Component Analysis, I was responsible for identifying the proper IC to use for charging or recharging the battery. However, after discussing with members from the 477 Staff, it is equally, if not more important, to first identify the type of battery required. Thus, this required some very high-level approximations of the power required by different components. I looked primarily at the microcontroller and the LED matrix since these will have considerable current draws. In doing so, I realized the LEDs will require much more power than our team had realized and may lead us to needing an alternate method of powering the gameboards. Overall, this was crucial for our team to identify so we may address the arising constraints. Next week, our team will work together to determine which powering method will be the most convenient and effective for the user. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Next week there will be a continued emphasis on the user and gameboard interaction; I will investigate more methods of creating a safe, but electrically possible way for the boats to contain the voltage dividers. I will continue to use this time to familiarize myself with KiCad in preparation for creating the PCB layout.

				During week 4, I was primarily focused on developing my understanding of KiCad. I watched each of the tutorial videos offered by DigiKey’s Youtube channel to familiarize myself with both the software and the general process of creating a schematic and PCB. This is critical going into next week because I will be responsible for the Mechanical Overview. After going through the tutorials, I tried to create my own mini PCB to demonstrate my understanding. The one I designed is just a very simple voltage divider with a hole poking through the center for an LED to shine through. Although this is a very straight forward design, it took me many different attempts to line everything up perfectly; I researched different LED sizes and tried to approximate the distances between holes in a protoboard. The goal of this chip was to organize the resistors used in the boat peg detection. Not only would this keep the wiring and connectivity straight forward, but it would also standardize the spacing for each of the boats. (Each of the boats would have two of these PCBs glued into the bottom of them, one at each of the furthest pegs.) Once I completed the design, I used the ECE Shop’s Advanced Manufacturing Team to print a few test boards. A couple of them had shorting issues and needed to be reprinted, but I ultimately used those to practice surface mount soldering. <br>

				While our team continues to investigate the most effective ways to detect the ships, by creating this prototype we were able to get a better understanding of the sizing constraints and the amount of future soldering and fabrication. On top of this, by having a physical example, I was able to start brainstorming how this piece would connect into the board – our next area of focus. For this, we are thinking to use female and male headers, however this could lead to potential durability issues. Next week I plan to make some revisions to the PCB to add rails (for additional support) and solder down some female headers to a protoboard to verify its durability. <br><br>
				This week was a great opportunity for me to further my understanding of KiCad and to prepare myself for the PCB layout that I will begin this upcoming week. I was able to continue testing some of the mechanical aspects of our design and identify new constraints. Next week, I will continue prototyping and I look forward to beginning our PCB. <br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			
				Throughout Week 5, our team was demonstrated a specific focus on deciding our ship detection method. We had prototyped a couple different versions in the past (such as the voltage dividers and the individually PCB methods), but at this point we recognized the importance of nailing down a concept and refining it with the remaining time. With that being said, I prototyped a version of using DC plugs (barrel and barrel jacks) for the boat pegs and detection. The barrels would be glue into the boat and the jacks would be placed beneath the acrylic sheet. This was a great idea in concept: very clean looking, easy to assemble, and plugging in would be easy. Additionally, by wiring this similarly to a switch (connecting on the ground pin to ground and the reference – detect – pin to a pull up resistor) it was very evident when the barrel (boat) was detected. I wired up a couple different jacks and monitors the results with varying current and voltages using a DMM and Oscilloscope.  <br>
	
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/barrel.jpg" width="400" height="350"></img></p>
	
				However, during our lab time we decided to go with a different method of using header pins and female headers, very similar to my initial prototyping but without the resistors. Our team came to this conclusion primarily because although the barrels where very easy to click into the jacks, they required significant force to remove from them. Ultimately, this would put significant strain on the PCB and board itself. This step in the prototyping process was critical because it helped narrow down our options and decide the best method going forward. Now, we have a concrete methodology that we will use, one that we decided on based on the previous prototyping attempts. <br> <br>
				Additionally, I continued ordering more components such as LEDs, motor, housing unit, and more. I also spent time in the ECE Shop looking for parts already available and determining which parts can be adapted to our project to reduce the cost. One of the biggest finds was the ESP32 microcontrollers, which is very beneficial but also seeing it in person made me realize that we will require a solder stencil – something that if we waited until after we ordered the chip to realize could have seriously hindered our prototyping time.  <br> <br>
				When the housing unit arrived, I immediately began measuring and creating various layouts. I used pieces of paper and components we are incorporating to get a better understanding of the variety of layout options and distributions. This was also incredibly important for the Mechanical Overview, which I was responsible for this week. After playing with the dimensions of the housing unit a little more and understanding the space availability, our team has been more successful in compiling a realistic mental image of the final product.  <br> <br>
				The majority of my time devoted this week was focused on completing the Mechanical Overview. The most challenging part was completing the CAD design and the PCB Layout. To complete the PCB layout, I first used Powerpoint to get proper dimensions for each device. Once I had the exact sizes, I was able to use some of the drawing features to play with different Row PCB sizes to estimate the amount of space our team will need for connectors at the end of each row, as well as the daisy-chain type connections. This alone took me a few hours to ensure everything was as accurate and precise as possible, as we are dealing with relatively small dimensions and even just one inch can make the difference of one of the PCBs fitting our not. <br>
				
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/slides.jpg" width="800" height="150"></img></p>

				Finally, the CAD designing was very challenging for me – particularly because I had never used a CAD software before. I tried three different CAD softwares to get the specific features I was looking for, but eventually settled on one and did the best I could to represent my imagined final product. During this time, it was mainly trial and error; I spent a lot of time researching how to do simple things such as “move a design” and differentiate terms such as “body” from “sketch”. While this process felt extremely tedious, it helped me envision the final product, and further portray that image to others. By spending the time completing this portion of the Mechanical Overview, I gained confidence in our spacing and housing unit’s dimensions, and most importantly identified which areas within the unit will be the most constrained, and potentially cause problems down the road if not precisely measured. <br>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/cad.jpg" width="500" height="400"></img></p>
				Overall, this week helped me become more comfortable with the physical layouts of the design, including the PCBs. With that being said, I am looking forward to spending time next week finalizing footprints and schematics. I will also finish ordering our required materials and continue testing components as they arrive. <br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				This week my primary focus was completing the schematics and footprints for our PCB designs. As this was my first time building schematics on my own, a lot of time was poured into double and triple checking my work as well as looking up best practices. A few of the challenges I faced with the schematic were finding the correct footprints and correct ICs. Although our team had collaborated on the BOM, it wasn’t until this week that we realized there were still some things that needed to be considered. For instance, in the first attempt of the Main PCB, I completely forgot to add the programming circuitry. Thankfully, my team was able to catch it upon review, and I needed to find a new IC and Micro USB connector in a pinch. With that being said, this also helped me pay even closer attention to detail. With the final PCB layouts due next week, I will be paying extremely close attention and looking out for anything we may have missed in previous steps. <br> <br>
				Our design utilizes two different PCBs: one for each row on each of the grids (16 rows total, 8 on the attack board and 8 on the ship board) and one for hosting the ESP32 as well as additional modules such as the LCD screen and speaker. The first schematic I worked on was the Grid or Row PCB. This took me roughly 5 hours to complete, primarily because I was continuously checking the datasheets for the components, making sure I was getting exactly the correct functionality and sizing in the footprints. To help me, I rewatched the KiCad videos at the same time to make sure I wasn’t missing any critical steps, especially when I created the footprint for the 8:1 Mux (the 74HC151). Below is my draft of the Row schematic (which was later reviewed and cleaned up by team) as well as a footprint sketch and finalized footprint for the 74HC151. <br><br>

				<img src="Team/progress/molly/fp1.jpg" width="400" height="300"></img></p>
				The main PCB was much more challenging for me; I revisited it many times throughout the week. In my first attempt, I was using the hierarchical sheets (similar to the cleaned up version of the Row PCB), but this ended up being tedious and more work than necessary. Throughout the week my team gave critical feedback to help me improve the footprints as well as the schematics. One thing I learned while working on the main PCB schematics was that I can use whatever symbol I’d like to best fit the schematic, so long as the footprint matches up to the pins and to the device itself. An example of this is that I needed to create a symbol for a voltage regulator, but it has the generic SOT223 footprint.<br><br>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/main_pcb_schematic.jpg" width="700" height="500"></img></p>
				This week was truly a time of growth; I am beyond excited about the experience I gained in working with KiCad, and while I’m sure there are little details that will continued to be improved upon, I am very proud of the work and effort I put in this week. Our team came together to guide me through the schematic process by identifying necessary changes and small errors, while giving me the space to learn and the responsibility to complete the tasks at hand. Looking to next week, I am excited to continue my KiCad journey and focus on making an organized, thorough layout of the PCBs. Next week I am also hoping to begin the 3D boat printing process to make sure our sizing is correct and finish ordering any last minute components – at this point I have ordered everything we initially planned for needing. <br><br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				This week my focus was finalizing any schematics and working on the PCB Layout. While I was supposed to be predominantly responsible for the PCB layout, I realized early in the week that the task was too large for just me, particularly because this is my first PCB design experience. With that being said, Mitch played a critical role in supporting the designs for both PCBs and teaching me along the way. <br> <br>
				For the main PCB, I initially helped by sorting through the rat’s nest and ultimately sorting the circuit subsystems into separate chunks. From here, it was easier for Mitch and me to take a closer look at the footprint pinouts and reassign pins on the ESP32 and relevant components. Additionally, I worked through some of our primary heat and footprint concerns. For instance, the MOSFET and LDO can create a significant amount of heat if not carefully considered. I did some basic power calculations provided on the LDO datasheet to determine the maximum power dissipated. After identifying the thermal concern from the power dissipated, I reached out to Joe for recommendations. Ultimately, the best course of action for this situation will be to include a large power plane surrounding the Vout pin on the LDO, covering it with vias, and placing another power plane on the other side. Another potential solution would be to use the 5V supply (VBus) for the LEDs, which would significantly reduce the load on the LDO while still providing sufficient voltage for the LEDs. As for the MOSFET, our team will go with a specific P-Channel with a much lower internal resistance, which will create a lower voltage drop and lower the risk of getting too hot. From a footprint point of view, this means we can use an upright MOSFET instead of a flat orientation. <br><br>
				For the Row PCB, I finalized the proper sizing of the board and spacing between the pegs and LEDs. In order to do so, I re-measured the box dimensions and provided some additional space allowance to each of the rows. To find proper spacing, I drew everything to scale and made exact measurements. Then, to double check, I utilized some additional lines in KiCad and spaced them an inch apart (to resemble grid lines) and double checked the measurements between the center of the pegs and each line. On top of this, since I had the exact measurements between the peg holes, I was able to use this to modify a previous CAD version of the boat to include the holes with exact placement. For this, I utilized the hand-drawn measurements I already had but took a couple millimeters from each side to ensure the boat would not overcrowd any grid squares. I included a small rectangular platform on the bottom of the ship in order to completely cover the LED in the farthest squares. This was a potential concern since the boat from the STL file we are using is very narrow and could leave some exposed LED. Additionally, the boat has been printed in a specific way to allow our team to place the small pegs inside the boat then glue the top on separately; this reduces risk of damaging our boats when drilling through them to place the pegs. Additionally, the sizing of the rectangular platform was highly successful as seen by how flush the pegs are with the bottom of the boat. <br><br>

				This week I learned a significant amount about KiCad and PCB Design and identified shortcuts in OnShape (CAD software) to facilitate boat modification. Looking ahead to the design review, my focus will be critiquing, finalizing, and debugging our PCB layout as well as completing the design review presentation. If time allows, I would like to continue working with CAD to begin modifying and printing boats of different sizes as this will be a rather lengthy process. <br><br>

				Last week, in order to prep for the Midterm Design Review, I finished the initial CAD prototypes for each of the boats and printed them. This week, I worked towards finalizing the models by ensuring the dimensions and assembly of the boats. <br> <br>
				For starters, the biggest concern with printing the boats was the spacing of peg holes. This will be absolutely critical because even just 0.1mm off and the boats will not be able to align with the female sockets on our PCBs. (We are currently planning to only need pegs on the first and last holes of the boats, however I made holes for each grid square covered in the event that we need more pegs for detection later on.) <br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/boat_align.jpg" width="400" height="200"></img></p>

				Aside from the alignment however, I did discover a couple flaws that I began to address. The first of which were CAD related – some of the boats had a larger platform on the bottom than desired, the shell for the interior of the boats was too thick for the pegs, etc. For this, I went back into the CAD models and began adjusting the models based on measurements of the first boat I created. The most significant change will be the thickness of the boat platforms. As seen in the previous progress report, the first CAD model I completed had a perfectly flushed bottom with the pegs. In some of the other prints, this was not the case. This came from a variety of issues that ultimately just took some playing around in CAD to realize it was from mismatched measurements. Thus, I adjusted the measurements and ensure the boats all had the same corresponding thicknesses. On top of this, I needed to adjust the tops of most of the boats. In my initial modifications, the idea was to create boats that were easy to grab hold on to when placing and pulling them out, however the 2-peg and 3-peg boats came out very thick and the 4-peg came out very thin. So, I adjusted the depths of each of their “tops” in order to improve visual appeal and maintain tactility. <br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/top_issue_boats.jpg" width="400" height="500"></img></p>

				Finally, as I began testing the actual peg inserts to the boats, I came across issues with the very tips of the boats having steep curves making it difficult to insert the protoboard cuts. In order to fix this, I attempted sanding down the sides of the protoboard and ultimately trying to shape them to fit inside the boat but still have sufficient surface area beneath for gluing <br>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/peg_issue_boats.jpg" width="300" height="400"></img></p>

				Aside from the boats, this week I took some time to attend meetings with Joe and Mitch to continue finalizing the PCB. I helped in updating some of the footprints and moving the mounting holes (advice from our Midterm Design Review). Ultimately, I continued learning about KiCad in this process – primarily how to use power/ground planes to create much wider traces for connections. I ordered everything we recently decided we needed (within the previous 2 weeks) and ordered our PCBs! <br> <br>
				Looking ahead to next week, I don’t expect our PCBs to be arriving yet, which will give me ample time to start printing out the final iterations of the boats and complete their peg assembly. On top of this, I plan to begin some of the aesthetics of our boards – painting the box and keypad, cutting and drilling the acrylic for the gameboard, and creating holes in the box for power and speaker potentiometer. Nonetheless, I will be completing the individual assignment for next week as well and giving that the priority. <br> <br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				This week was a rather odd time for our team; we are patiently waiting for our PCBs to arrive (they have been processed and shipped successfully as of the late night of 10/28) and most of our key components have been prototyped. With that being said, I continued perfecting our boats by redoing the last print based on the updates to the CAD file I completed last week. On top of this, I continued creating some of the boat and peg related components. <br>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk10/all_boats.jpg" width="400" height="400"></img></p>

				As for the peg specific components, I began breaking apart and sanding the female sockets, which will be soldered into our Grid PCBs. This process has taken some fiddling with as the sockets rarely break in the expected areas and require a lot of sanding to get down to the proper size. The sanding will be more critical later once they are actually attached to the board in order for the LEDs to fit properly.<br>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk10/f_sock.jpg" width="400" height="200"></img></p>
				
				Additionally, I worked on actually creating the pegs for the boats. This process was a little more tedious and took many failed attempts, throughout the semester as well. This week I reorganized my techniques and found a more methodical way of creating the pegs. I tried this out with out 4-peg boat, which also has the curviest front and back making it the most difficult to secure. <br> <br>
				First, I cut prototype boards down to a more realistic size to fit into the boat themselves. I needed to do some rounding and sanding to make sure it would fit snuggly into first and last pegs of the boat. From there, I broke apart double male headers into groups of 4. Thankfully, I managed to find some extra long headers that will make this process substantially easier. Next, I would align the group of 4 into the correct spacing in the protoboard and bend the top pins to hold it in place for soldering. The soldering job for each of the pegs is rather self-explanatory: short all of the pins, apply a lot of solder to secure the header in place. Finally, I just needed to cut the protoboards one last time to reduce the amount of light-blocking protoboard in the boat. <br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk10/complete_boat.jpg" width="400" height="150"></img></p>

				
				Finally, this week I also completed the individual Legal Analysis assignment. This was rather difficult just because I had a hard time understanding some of the patents’ wording. However, with a little time and a lot of re-reading, I was able to understand the most critical portions of each of the patents. <br><br>
				Looking forward to next week, I am thrilled to be getting our PCBs! We will have a substantial amount of soldering to complete (256 LEDs total, and that’s just the LEDs) so I hope to get started on that and ensuring the boat alignment with the peg holes. <br><br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				This week was extremely busy for me academically, with two exams and a project deadline, however I was able to work on developing our PCBs. The boards arrived late Tuesday night, so I was able to spend time on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday working with the PCBs. <br> <br>
				Since our team will need 32 of our grid PCBs, I almost immediately started soldering – after checking the continuity of the pins. During my first attempt, I used solder paste and a metal pick to place each of the components. This was primarily because I was unfamiliar with solder paste and wanted to get a feeling for the consistency, process, and what potential issues to look for (i.e., bridging or not enough paste on the pad). This was extremely time consuming and without using the microscope, would have been near impossible. However, it was successful, nonetheless. I was able to complete this board just in time for lab, where we were able to then use some of the code that was already written to test the LEDs and find that it worked perfectly (with a boat attached and all)! From there, it is just a matter of implementing the rest of the boards. <br> <br>

				Once I was more comfortable with solder paste, I started using the reflow over and our custom stencils. It took a couple of tries to get the stencil to work exactly as intended, but after that I was able to start laying down the stencil must faster. Additionally, I became comfortable enough with the process by lab time on Wednesday that I was able to teach Joe and Garrett and help each of them use the stencil and place their own pieces. <br> <br>
				I spent some more time on my own adding the multiplexors to the ends of each of the stenciled (and cooked) grid boards as well as putting more boards in the oven. One significant factor I noticed was that because of the length of our boards, we need to be very careful when we are cooking; often times the oven’s heat is so centralized that the resistors and capacitors at the ends of the boards are not fully soldered. To fix this, after each complete wave in the oven, I inspect the boards and touch up any components. <br> <br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk11/1.jpg" width="400" height="200"></img></p>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk11/2.jpg" width="400" height="200"></img></p>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk11/3.jpg" width="400" height="300"></img></p>
				
				Finally, today Mitch and I were able to fully implement and test the power supply circuitry on our main board (I had done continuity checking prior). This was something I was particularly nervous about testing because with the voltage regulator we are using can be set to an incorrect resistance from the potentiometer and actually damage the microcontroller. With that being said, it was much better to have two eyes looking at the circuit at the same time.
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk11/4.jpg" width="400" height="400"></img></p>
				Looking ahead to next week, I am extremely excited to hopefully finish up the grid PCBs and continue isolated implementation on our main boards. If we are able to finish all of the solder and circuitry this week, the next steps would be crimping all of the wires into our MTA connectors and working on our connections between boards.

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>

				This week my primary focus was populating as many of our PCBs as possible. For the ESP32 board (or Main board), last week we completed the power supply subsystem, this week I added the components for the Lipo Charging subsystem, USB to Serial subsystem, Auto-reset, and some additional components such as resistors and capacitors. At this point, Mitch played a critical role in testing the components, and we discovered that the USB to Serial bridge IC that we were using was being powered with the wrong voltage, and more significantly, outputting voltages that were too high on the RX and TX lines ultimately fried the ESP32. In order to fix this, a couple of the traces were scratched out, and we added an additional voltage divider to keep the Reset pin from floating. Then, I de-soldered and re-soldered a new ESP32 onto the board. Now, we are able to identify the ESP32 on a computer, however the device itself is not being recognized, and thus we are unable to program it. This will be a primary concern going into next week. <br><br>
				During this week, I also spent a substantial amount of time working with the Grid PCBs. At this point, we have 24 boards that are populated with LEDs, resistors, capacitors, and connectors – some of these boards still need multiplexors however we are running very low and more will be ordered this weekend. Of these 24, 17 boards are working as expected and the others have varying issues with LEDs not turning on. <br><br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk12/IMG_5318.jpg" width="700" height="400"></img></p>

				I believe the issues with the Grid PCBs is a result of the oven and solder paste. Moreover, because the Grid boards are quite long, the solder joints on either end of the board are sometimes incomplete (the solder doesn’t actually get hot enough in the oven to flow), which leads to a series of connection issues. To fix this, I have been looking at the joints on each of the broken boards, and re-heating with an iron to improve connections, or adding more solder to joints with minimal connection. Another area to look at is the power and ground connectors; if these have poor solder joints then it is possible that the LEDs are not getting powered. <br><br>
				Going into next week, I am trying to complete all 32 required Grid PCB boards (and also adding the female headers for the actual boat input) as well as finish the ESP32 board as much as possible. Of course, we will need to first diagnose programming situation, but hopefully once that is complete we will be able to continue with the other subsystems on the board. As for the Grid PCBs, the female headers still need to be cut down to size, sanded, and soldered on (I have a good amount of the headers cut down and sanded, but not quite 128 of them).  A stretch goal for this week is to start mounting our grid PCBs into the game box! <br><br>

				As the final deadlines are approaching, our team has redirected its focus to working together towards building the first game board. In the very beginning of this week, Garrett and I worked on finalizing enough of the boards for a full bottom (or ship) board. This included cutting double and single headers to size, gluing together, if necessary, perfectly lining them up, then soldering them into each of the Grid PCBs (8 groups of 4 sockets are needed for each row, 64 total per game. The attack grid will not need these sockets because they are used for ship detection only). During this process, Garrett and I learned after the first couple boards that we needed a simple, consistent method of lining up the sockets, because during soldering they tended to shift slightly, and would be misaligned. To do so, we created extra long headers (by gluing multiple together) and taping them down horizontally with the PCB. This way, we could tape the sockets into place and ensure the alignment of them with regards to each other. <br><br>
				During the week, our team began experiencing many technical difficulties with our Main PCB. Primarily, some of the pins we are using on the ESP32 are not designed for our intended functionalities. With that being said, this week I tried to support Mitch in the process of debugging and determining the issues with our board. To help us isolate some of the USB to Serial problems, I started populating a new Main PCB (we only need 2 boards, I ordered 5) and directly fly-wired connections, from the TX and RX pins from where the USB to Serial IC should have been, to a breadboard prototype using the FTDI, USB to UART development board. <br><br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk13/IMG_5330.jpg" width="400" height="400"></img></p>

				This seemingly worked temporarily, however at this point we were still having unpredictable outputs; sometimes everything appeared to be working nominally, and the next, everything has crashed. With that being said, Mitch did a lot more research into narrowing down the problem, and determined that we need to reassign/repurpose some of the connections to the ESP32. We discussed different ways to fly-wire the connections, which pins will need to include pull-down resistors (all of the input-only pins), and so on. On top of this, he helped me begin setting up the required tools for flashing the ESP32 so I can continue with this debugging process next week. Overall, we established a gameplan as to how to plan to fix some of the connection issues, and now we will just need more testing.<br><br>
				This week I also drew up a diagram of the board layout and the proper spacings for the sockets and screw holes for the ECE Machine Shop in order to cut our acrylic sheet. Unfortunately, the machine shop is experiencing AutoCad issues and may not be able to have our sheet cut until later next week (potentially even after break), which will greatly limit our time to actually mount the PCBs into the box and to the acrylic. In order to make sure the PCBs were perfectly laid out, I created an 8 inch outline (the room available in the box for grid), lined up the first board, then used a couple of the complete boats to ensure each of the boards was properly lined up with the others. In continuation of the boat building process, the last set of (matching) boats was printed this week and ready to be assembled. <br><br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk13/IMG_5332.jpg" width="400" height="400"></img></p>

				Overall, this week was tough, and our team has started to feel the pressure of the nearing deadlines. Moving into Monday and Tuesday of next week, I will be trying to do more debugging and fly-wiring in order to get our main PCB to be buildable and flashable.

				With this week being Thanksgiving Break, my responsibilities throughout the week were more spread across different aspects of our project. One of the biggest things I worked on was installing the required tools and software for the ESP32 for programming and flashing. Mitch helped me get everything working properly, however it took multiple attempts and hours to get everything running; even so, the current setup I have allows me to flash the software, but I run into many errors trying to build. To get around the building issue, Mitch was able to build the code on his end (to reflect pin adjustments) then send me the zipped file to flash and run the serial monitor. The pictures below exhibit proper flashing then proper monitoring. <br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk14/1.jpg" width="300" height="250"></img></p>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk14/2.jpg" width="300" height="250"></img></p>

				The main reason for getting set up with the software side is so I could work on making the pin adjustments and testing. Moreover, Mitch discovered issues with some of the pins we had selected (some were input only, some were directly connected to memory) and we discussed possible solutions. In the process of making the changes, I soldered on a couple more components and pull down resistors and utilized the exposes JTAG pins and the couple extra debug pins we included to properly wire the keypad and LCD display. At first, the ESP32 would not flash, and we later determined it to be directly correlated to the motor subsystem. To fix this, I completely desoldered the mosfet and pull down resistors (since they were using the ground from the mosfet), since the motor line going into the mosfet comes from one of the pins not recommended for use on the ESP32 datasheet. Then, we were able to flash and test the setup. <br><br>
					
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk14/temp3_wk14.jpg" width="400" height="400"></img></p>

				Currently the keypad is responding to only a couple (incorrect) buttons being pressed and the LCD display is not turning on at tall. Today I spent substantial time investigating the keypad for possible sources of error with some help from Garrett. Eventually, it became apparent that the rows and columns were switched and needed to be changed in both the code and in the connections. This was because in the first setup, the rows were identifying button pushes instead of the columns, to provide input to the ESP32. To fix this, I adjusted the GPIO values on Garrett’s computer, then built and sent myself the zipped file to flash on my own computer. This still had only a couple of buttons being identified, however Garrett and I both believe it to be a result of the additional pull down resistors on a couple of the rows. So, I desoldered the pull down resistors, but did not have enough time to test it without them – this will be first on the list of things to do for next week. <br><br>
				Finally, early this week our clear gameboard covers for the Grid PCBs were cut and I was able to pick them up. They were not cut with the specific acrylic we had purchased which means the thickness is slightly off and it is much more clear than expected, however it still looks very clean. Next week I will be returning to the machine shop to ask for another cut (without the socket holes) for the top boards. <br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/wk14/IMG_5378.gif" width="350" height="400"></img></p>

				Overall, this week was still pretty productive, regardless of the break. Moving forward, the pressure to get the ESP32 programmed correctly is significant, however I believe our team will rise to the occasion. <br>
