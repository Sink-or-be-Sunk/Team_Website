            <h2>Progress Report for Molly Arito</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/2/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Throughout Week 1 of the Sink or be Sunk project, our team was primarily focused on completing the Final Design Proposal document and continuing to build upon and solidify concepts for functionality. During this time, I contributed to the brainstorm for coordinate detection methods and additional sensory elements (such as sound and vibration). By using an online Word document, the sections of the proposal were easily divided; I was responsible for updating the overall project description, which was mostly carry-over from my portion in the Initial Project Proposal. For this, I made slight changes to the solution based on feedback from Todd and discussion from the team. In doing so, the team has a more unified understanding of the high-level project goals. To further support this, I assisted in the creation of our PSSCs by highlighting the most significant elements of our project (such as ship detection and WiFi connection). From Week 1, I learned about the ESP32 capabilities through our discussions of different microcontrollers and their capabilities. I also learned a substantial amount from Mitch, particularly about Websockets and WiFi connectivity. Going forward, I will need to place an emphasis on the physical layout of the ship-placing board and look into battery management systems, in order to begin planning for our PCBs.<br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/3/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            In the beginning of this week, I began investigating Battery Management Systems (BMS). Since this is my first time working with one, I watched online tutorials and read explanations to get a higher understanding of their capabilities. In doing so, I learned about the variety of BMS add-ons – such as having both charging and discharging capabilities and indicators, and end of life indicators based on charge ratios. While this is still my first time with these systems, with a lot left to learn, this helped me become more comfortable discussing our options with the team. Going forward, I will continue looking into different types of boards and help the team identify which BMS boards are most suitable for our project.</br></br>

			In addition to this, I met with Mitch to further discuss his concept for ship detection. Since I am taking on the role as hardware engineer, it is critical I have a sound understanding on the electrical components of the project. I had some confusion regarding the ADC checking over the various pegs and voltage dividers, however Mitch provided a breadboard example and further explained how the pegs will be multiplexed into just a few channels. From here, I felt more comfortable with the overall idea, and eager to begin testing. I ordered our first round of parts (12 Analog Multiplexers - Texas Instruments/SN74LV4051AN). Once the parts arrive, I will be able to begin testing by simulating just a couple “rows” from the ship-detection board. To prepare for testing, I took a Digital Multiplexer and did some minor testing to refresh my understanding of 8:1 multiplexing and their select line logic. Now, when the parts arrive sometime next week, I will feel more suitable for testing and circuit assembly. During this time, I learned about the difference between analog and digital multiplexing, and more specifically how digital signals are discretized, which could cause some unpredictable results in multiplexing. </br></br>

			Throughout this week, our team was tasked with completing the Functional Specification document; I was responsible for completing the Other Constraints portion. For this portion, I highlighted elements of our game that fall outside the typical Mechanical, Electronic, and Economic constraints. This narrowed my focus on user interfacing. I brainstormed high-level constraint ideas with the team, some of which were later applied in the other constraint categories. From there, I further explained these constraints and provided evidence towards a potential health hazard of too much LED exposure on the eyes. Going forward, it is critical for our team to consider these constraints in order to optimize gameplay engagement for our targeted audience. From our Functional Specification document, I learned more about the arrangement of the ESP32 channels, particularly because I was also working to better understand the constraints of multiplexing our boat pegs into a suitable number of signals for the ADC. Further, this helped me understand the pin constraints of the ESP32; in the future we will need to identify how many of the channels on the ESP32 can be saved for the ship detection based on how many pins we will need for GPIO, PWM, DAC, and so on. Looking ahead, the goals for next week will be to further my understanding of KiCad by watching tutorials and creating simple schematics. This will be beneficial during PCB planning. <br>
