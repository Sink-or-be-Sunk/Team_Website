				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				Throughout Week 1 of the Sink or be Sunk project, our team was primarily focused on completing the Final Design Proposal document and continuing to build upon and solidify concepts for functionality. During this time, I contributed to the brainstorm for coordinate detection methods and additional sensory elements (such as sound and vibration). By using an online Word document, the sections of the proposal were easily divided; I was responsible for updating the overall project description, which was mostly carry-over from my portion in the Initial Project Proposal. For this, I made slight changes to the solution based on feedback from Todd and discussion from the team. In doing so, the team has a more unified understanding of the high-level project goals. To further support this, I assisted in the creation of our PSSCs by highlighting the most significant elements of our project (such as ship detection and WiFi connection). From Week 1, I learned about the ESP32 capabilities through our discussions of different microcontrollers and their capabilities. I also learned a substantial amount from Mitch, particularly about Websockets and WiFi connectivity. Going forward, I will need to place an emphasis on the physical layout of the ship-placing board and look into battery management systems, in order to begin planning for our PCBs.<br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				In the beginning of this week, I began investigating Battery Management Systems (BMS). Since this is my first time working with one, I watched online tutorials and read explanations to get a higher understanding of their capabilities. In doing so, I learned about the variety of BMS add-ons – such as having both charging and discharging capabilities and indicators, and end of life indicators based on charge ratios. While this is still my first time with these systems, with a lot left to learn, this helped me become more comfortable discussing our options with the team. Going forward, I will continue looking into different types of boards and help the team identify which BMS boards are most suitable for our project.</br></br>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/bms_notes.jpg" width="300" height="400"></img></p>

				In addition to this, I met with Mitch to further discuss his concept for ship detection. Since I am taking on the role as hardware engineer, it is critical I have a sound understanding on the electrical components of the project. I had some confusion regarding the ADC checking over the various pegs and voltage dividers, however Mitch provided a breadboard example and further explained how the pegs will be multiplexed into just a few channels. From here, I felt more comfortable with the overall idea, and eager to begin testing. I ordered our first round of parts (12 Analog Multiplexers - Texas Instruments/SN74LV4051AN). Once the parts arrive, I will be able to begin testing by simulating just a couple “rows” from the ship-detection board. To prepare for testing, I took a Digital Multiplexer and did some minor testing to refresh my understanding of 8:1 multiplexing and their select line logic. Now, when the parts arrive sometime next week, I will feel more suitable for testing and circuit assembly. During this time, I learned about the difference between analog and digital multiplexing, and more specifically how digital signals are discretized, which could cause some unpredictable results in multiplexing. </br></br>

				Throughout this week, our team was tasked with completing the Functional Specification document; I was responsible for completing the Other Constraints portion. For this portion, I highlighted elements of our game that fall outside the typical Mechanical, Electronic, and Economic constraints. This narrowed my focus on user interfacing. I brainstormed high-level constraint ideas with the team, some of which were later applied in the other constraint categories. From there, I further explained these constraints and provided evidence towards a potential health hazard of too much LED exposure on the eyes. Going forward, it is critical for our team to consider these constraints in order to optimize gameplay engagement for our targeted audience. From our Functional Specification document, I learned more about the arrangement of the ESP32 channels, particularly because I was also working to better understand the constraints of multiplexing our boat pegs into a suitable number of signals for the ADC. Further, this helped me understand the pin constraints of the ESP32; in the future we will need to identify how many of the channels on the ESP32 can be saved for the ship detection based on how many pins we will need for GPIO, PWM, DAC, and so on. Looking ahead, the goals for next week will be to further my understanding of KiCad by watching tutorials and creating simple schematics. This will be beneficial during PCB planning. <br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				In the beginning of this week, the analog multiplexers I ordered arrived and I was able to jump into testing. Initially, I tested the functionality of the device by placing only one voltage dividers to the Y0 pin and grounding the three select lines. This not only assured me of the functionality of the chip, but also demonstrated the accuracy of the chip (which was within 15% of the expected output). From here, I continued testing by migrating the voltage divider to the other output pins and manipulating the select line values. One of my concerns about the analog multiplexers was going to be the precision required for the select lines; upon further review and testing the select line, 70% of the Vcc value and above is identifies as “High”, and 30% of Vcc and lower identifies as “low”. This provides more flexibility than I had predicted and will become extremely beneficial when progressing to debugging stages, as we will be able to adjust the supply voltages with resistors to fit according. Once I had a solidified understanding of the singular analog multiplexer, I added a secondary multiplexer to imitate a second row on the player’s ship-placing board. Moreover, taking this extra step helped me visualize the layout of the final game board. Overall, it was critical to have a sound understanding of the analog multiplexers, their capabilities, and their constraints. As we progress into the next steps of circuitry and PCB design, our team will be able to better predict the functionality of the multiplexers, and thus the overall ship detection aspect of our game. </br></br>

				This week I 3D printed a prototype destroyer boat (from a free .stl file found online). Ultimately, this was to help our team visualize the sizing constraints for each of the pegs. After printing, we realized that we may need some type of flat panel on the bottom to evenly attach the voltage dividers. Moreover, one of the biggest challenges of this project will be finding a method of connecting the voltage dividers (inside of the boats) to the circuitry beneath the board, while still having room for the LEDs beneath to shine through. Throughout the week I brainstormed different methods of housing the voltage dividers in the bottom of the boat to electrically connect to the attack board. One idea I had was to open a push button and use the housing unit to store a soldered voltage divider. This was successful in that it just barely fit two resistors but had shortcomings in terms of supply power and ground and blocking the LED from shining through the boat. Next week, I plan to attempt to create a PCB (From the Advanced Manufacturing Team in the ECE Shop) with just a simple voltage divider and a hole in the middle for the LED beneath to shine through. If this is successful, there will be a standardized size for each of the pegs and a more organized method of placing the boats into the attack board.<br>

				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/boat2.jpg" width="600" height="400"></img></p>
				
				In order to complete Homework 4 – Component Analysis, I was responsible for identifying the proper IC to use for charging or recharging the battery. However, after discussing with members from the 477 Staff, it is equally, if not more important, to first identify the type of battery required. Thus, this required some very high-level approximations of the power required by different components. I looked primarily at the microcontroller and the LED matrix since these will have considerable current draws. In doing so, I realized the LEDs will require much more power than our team had realized and may lead us to needing an alternate method of powering the gameboards. Overall, this was crucial for our team to identify so we may address the arising constraints. Next week, our team will work together to determine which powering method will be the most convenient and effective for the user. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Next week there will be a continued emphasis on the user and gameboard interaction; I will investigate more methods of creating a safe, but electrically possible way for the boats to contain the voltage dividers. I will continue to use this time to familiarize myself with KiCad in preparation for creating the PCB layout.

				During week 4, I was primarily focused on developing my understanding of KiCad. I watched each of the tutorial videos offered by DigiKey’s Youtube channel to familiarize myself with both the software and the general process of creating a schematic and PCB. This is critical going into next week because I will be responsible for the Mechanical Overview. After going through the tutorials, I tried to create my own mini PCB to demonstrate my understanding. The one I designed is just a very simple voltage divider with a hole poking through the center for an LED to shine through. Although this is a very straight forward design, it took me many different attempts to line everything up perfectly; I researched different LED sizes and tried to approximate the distances between holes in a protoboard. The goal of this chip was to organize the resistors used in the boat peg detection. Not only would this keep the wiring and connectivity straight forward, but it would also standardize the spacing for each of the boats. (Each of the boats would have two of these PCBs glued into the bottom of them, one at each of the furthest pegs.) Once I completed the design, I used the ECE Shop’s Advanced Manufacturing Team to print a few test boards. A couple of them had shorting issues and needed to be reprinted, but I ultimately used those to practice surface mount soldering. <br>

				While our team continues to investigate the most effective ways to detect the ships, by creating this prototype we were able to get a better understanding of the sizing constraints and the amount of future soldering and fabrication. On top of this, by having a physical example, I was able to start brainstorming how this piece would connect into the board – our next area of focus. For this, we are thinking to use female and male headers, however this could lead to potential durability issues. Next week I plan to make some revisions to the PCB to add rails (for additional support) and solder down some female headers to a protoboard to verify its durability. <br><br>
				This week was a great opportunity for me to further my understanding of KiCad and to prepare myself for the PCB layout that I will begin this upcoming week. I was able to continue testing some of the mechanical aspects of our design and identify new constraints. Next week, I will continue prototyping and I look forward to beginning our PCB. <br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			
				Throughout Week 5, our team was demonstrated a specific focus on deciding our ship detection method. We had prototyped a couple different versions in the past (such as the voltage dividers and the individually PCB methods), but at this point we recognized the importance of nailing down a concept and refining it with the remaining time. With that being said, I prototyped a version of using DC plugs (barrel and barrel jacks) for the boat pegs and detection. The barrels would be glue into the boat and the jacks would be placed beneath the acrylic sheet. This was a great idea in concept: very clean looking, easy to assemble, and plugging in would be easy. Additionally, by wiring this similarly to a switch (connecting on the ground pin to ground and the reference – detect – pin to a pull up resistor) it was very evident when the barrel (boat) was detected. I wired up a couple different jacks and monitors the results with varying current and voltages using a DMM and Oscilloscope.  <br>
	
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/barrel.jpg" width="400" height="350"></img></p>
	
				However, during our lab time we decided to go with a different method of using header pins and female headers, very similar to my initial prototyping but without the resistors. Our team came to this conclusion primarily because although the barrels where very easy to click into the jacks, they required significant force to remove from them. Ultimately, this would put significant strain on the PCB and board itself. This step in the prototyping process was critical because it helped narrow down our options and decide the best method going forward. Now, we have a concrete methodology that we will use, one that we decided on based on the previous prototyping attempts. <br> <br>
				Additionally, I continued ordering more components such as LEDs, motor, housing unit, and more. I also spent time in the ECE Shop looking for parts already available and determining which parts can be adapted to our project to reduce the cost. One of the biggest finds was the ESP32 microcontrollers, which is very beneficial but also seeing it in person made me realize that we will require a solder stencil – something that if we waited until after we ordered the chip to realize could have seriously hindered our prototyping time.  <br> <br>
				When the housing unit arrived, I immediately began measuring and creating various layouts. I used pieces of paper and components we are incorporating to get a better understanding of the variety of layout options and distributions. This was also incredibly important for the Mechanical Overview, which I was responsible for this week. After playing with the dimensions of the housing unit a little more and understanding the space availability, our team has been more successful in compiling a realistic mental image of the final product.  <br> <br>
				The majority of my time devoted this week was focused on completing the Mechanical Overview. The most challenging part was completing the CAD design and the PCB Layout. To complete the PCB layout, I first used Powerpoint to get proper dimensions for each device. Once I had the exact sizes, I was able to use some of the drawing features to play with different Row PCB sizes to estimate the amount of space our team will need for connectors at the end of each row, as well as the daisy-chain type connections. This alone took me a few hours to ensure everything was as accurate and precise as possible, as we are dealing with relatively small dimensions and even just one inch can make the difference of one of the PCBs fitting our not. <br>
				
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/slides.jpg" width="800" height="150"></img></p>

				Finally, the CAD designing was very challenging for me – particularly because I had never used a CAD software before. I tried three different CAD softwares to get the specific features I was looking for, but eventually settled on one and did the best I could to represent my imagined final product. During this time, it was mainly trial and error; I spent a lot of time researching how to do simple things such as “move a design” and differentiate terms such as “body” from “sketch”. While this process felt extremely tedious, it helped me envision the final product, and further portray that image to others. By spending the time completing this portion of the Mechanical Overview, I gained confidence in our spacing and housing unit’s dimensions, and most importantly identified which areas within the unit will be the most constrained, and potentially cause problems down the road if not precisely measured. <br>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/cad.jpg" width="500" height="400"></img></p>
				Overall, this week helped me become more comfortable with the physical layouts of the design, including the PCBs. With that being said, I am looking forward to spending time next week finalizing footprints and schematics. I will also finish ordering our required materials and continue testing components as they arrive. <br>

				<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
				This week my primary focus was completing the schematics and footprints for our PCB designs. As this was my first time building schematics on my own, a lot of time was poured into double and triple checking my work as well as looking up best practices. A few of the challenges I faced with the schematic were finding the correct footprints and correct ICs. Although our team had collaborated on the BOM, it wasn’t until this week that we realized there were still some things that needed to be considered. For instance, in the first attempt of the Main PCB, I completely forgot to add the programming circuitry. Thankfully, my team was able to catch it upon review, and I needed to find a new IC and Micro USB connector in a pinch. With that being said, this also helped me pay even closer attention to detail. With the final PCB layouts due next week, I will be paying extremely close attention and looking out for anything we may have missed in previous steps. <br> <br>
				Our design utilizes two different PCBs: one for each row on each of the grids (16 rows total, 8 on the attack board and 8 on the ship board) and one for hosting the ESP32 as well as additional modules such as the LCD screen and speaker. The first schematic I worked on was the Grid or Row PCB. This took me roughly 5 hours to complete, primarily because I was continuously checking the datasheets for the components, making sure I was getting exactly the correct functionality and sizing in the footprints. To help me, I rewatched the KiCad videos at the same time to make sure I wasn’t missing any critical steps, especially when I created the footprint for the 8:1 Mux (the 74HC151). Below is my draft of the Row schematic (which was later reviewed and cleaned up by team) as well as a footprint sketch and finalized footprint for the 74HC151. <br><br>

				<img src="Team/progress/molly/fp1.jpg" width="400" height="300"></img></p>
				The main PCB was much more challenging for me; I revisited it many times throughout the week. In my first attempt, I was using the hierarchical sheets (similar to the cleaned up version of the Row PCB), but this ended up being tedious and more work than necessary. Throughout the week my team gave critical feedback to help me improve the footprints as well as the schematics. One thing I learned while working on the main PCB schematics was that I can use whatever symbol I’d like to best fit the schematic, so long as the footprint matches up to the pins and to the device itself. An example of this is that I needed to create a symbol for a voltage regulator, but it has the generic SOT223 footprint.<br><br>
				<p><img src="Team/progress/molly/main_pcb_schematic.jpg" width="700" height="500"></img></p>
				This week was truly a time of growth; I am beyond excited about the experience I gained in working with KiCad, and while I’m sure there are little details that will continued to be improved upon, I am very proud of the work and effort I put in this week. Our team came together to guide me through the schematic process by identifying necessary changes and small errors, while giving me the space to learn and the responsibility to complete the tasks at hand. Looking to next week, I am excited to continue my KiCad journey and focus on making an organized, thorough layout of the PCBs. Next week I am also hoping to begin the 3D boat printing process to make sure our sizing is correct and finish ordering any last minute components – at this point I have ordered everything we initially planned for needing. <br><br>
