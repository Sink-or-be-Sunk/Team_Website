            <h2>Progress Report for Molly Arito</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/2/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Throughout Week 1 of the Sink or be Sunk project, our team was primarily focused on completing the Final Design Proposal document and continuing to build upon and solidify concepts for functionality. During this time, I contributed to the brainstorm for coordinate detection methods and additional sensory elements (such as sound and vibration). By using an online Word document, the sections of the proposal were easily divided; I was responsible for updating the overall project description, which was mostly carry-over from my portion in the Initial Project Proposal. For this, I made slight changes to the solution based on feedback from Todd and discussion from the team. In doing so, the team has a more unified understanding of the high-level project goals. To further support this, I assisted in the creation of our PSSCs by highlighting the most significant elements of our project (such as ship detection and WiFi connection). From Week 1, I learned about the ESP32 capabilities through our discussions of different microcontrollers and their capabilities. I also learned a substantial amount from Mitch, particularly about Websockets and WiFi connectivity. Going forward, I will need to place an emphasis on the physical layout of the ship-placing board and look into battery management systems, in order to begin planning for our PCBs.<br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/3/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            In the beginning of this week, I began investigating Battery Management Systems (BMS). Since this is my first time working with one, I watched online tutorials and read explanations to get a higher understanding of their capabilities. In doing so, I learned about the variety of BMS add-ons – such as having both charging and discharging capabilities and indicators, and end of life indicators based on charge ratios. While this is still my first time with these systems, with a lot left to learn, this helped me become more comfortable discussing our options with the team. Going forward, I will continue looking into different types of boards and help the team identify which BMS boards are most suitable for our project.</br></br>

			In addition to this, I met with Mitch to further discuss his concept for ship detection. Since I am taking on the role as hardware engineer, it is critical I have a sound understanding on the electrical components of the project. I had some confusion regarding the ADC checking over the various pegs and voltage dividers, however Mitch provided a breadboard example and further explained how the pegs will be multiplexed into just a few channels. From here, I felt more comfortable with the overall idea, and eager to begin testing. I ordered our first round of parts (12 Analog Multiplexers - Texas Instruments/SN74LV4051AN). Once the parts arrive, I will be able to begin testing by simulating just a couple “rows” from the ship-detection board. To prepare for testing, I took a Digital Multiplexer and did some minor testing to refresh my understanding of 8:1 multiplexing and their select line logic. Now, when the parts arrive sometime next week, I will feel more suitable for testing and circuit assembly. During this time, I learned about the difference between analog and digital multiplexing, and more specifically how digital signals are discretized, which could cause some unpredictable results in multiplexing. </br></br>

			Throughout this week, our team was tasked with completing the Functional Specification document; I was responsible for completing the Other Constraints portion. For this portion, I highlighted elements of our game that fall outside the typical Mechanical, Electronic, and Economic constraints. This narrowed my focus on user interfacing. I brainstormed high-level constraint ideas with the team, some of which were later applied in the other constraint categories. From there, I further explained these constraints and provided evidence towards a potential health hazard of too much LED exposure on the eyes. Going forward, it is critical for our team to consider these constraints in order to optimize gameplay engagement for our targeted audience. From our Functional Specification document, I learned more about the arrangement of the ESP32 channels, particularly because I was also working to better understand the constraints of multiplexing our boat pegs into a suitable number of signals for the ADC. Further, this helped me understand the pin constraints of the ESP32; in the future we will need to identify how many of the channels on the ESP32 can be saved for the ship detection based on how many pins we will need for GPIO, PWM, DAC, and so on. Looking ahead, the goals for next week will be to further my understanding of KiCad by watching tutorials and creating simple schematics. This will be beneficial during PCB planning. <br>

			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/10/2021 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 15 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			In the beginning of this week, the analog multiplexers I ordered arrived and I was able to jump into testing. Initially, I tested the functionality of the device by placing only one voltage dividers to the Y0 pin and grounding the three select lines. This not only assured me of the functionality of the chip, but also demonstrated the accuracy of the chip (which was within 15% of the expected output). From here, I continued testing by migrating the voltage divider to the other output pins and manipulating the select line values. One of my concerns about the analog multiplexers was going to be the precision required for the select lines; upon further review and testing the select line, 70% of the Vcc value and above is identifies as “High”, and 30% of Vcc and lower identifies as “low”. This provides more flexibility than I had predicted and will become extremely beneficial when progressing to debugging stages, as we will be able to adjust the supply voltages with resistors to fit according. Once I had a solidified understanding of the singular analog multiplexer, I added a secondary multiplexer to imitate a second row on the player’s ship-placing board. Moreover, taking this extra step helped me visualize the layout of the final game board. Overall, it was critical to have a sound understanding of the analog multiplexers, their capabilities, and their constraints. As we progress into the next steps of circuitry and PCB design, our team will be able to better predict the functionality of the multiplexers, and thus the overall ship detection aspect of our game. </br></br>

			This week I 3D printed a prototype destroyer boat (from a free .stl file found online). Ultimately, this was to help our team visualize the sizing constraints for each of the pegs. After printing, we realized that we may need some type of flat panel on the bottom to evenly attach the voltage dividers. Moreover, one of the biggest challenges of this project will be finding a method of connecting the voltage dividers (inside of the boats) to the circuitry beneath the board, while still having room for the LEDs beneath to shine through. Throughout the week I brainstormed different methods of housing the voltage dividers in the bottom of the boat to electrically connect to the attack board. One idea I had was to open a push button and use the housing unit to store a soldered voltage divider. This was successful in that it just barely fit two resistors but had shortcomings in terms of supply power and ground and blocking the LED from shining through the boat. Next week, I plan to attempt to create a PCB (From the Advanced Manufacturing Team in the ECE Shop) with just a simple voltage divider and a hole in the middle for the LED beneath to shine through. If this is successful, there will be a standardized size for each of the pegs and a more organized method of placing the boats into the attack board.<br>

			In order to complete Homework 4 – Component Analysis, I was responsible for identifying the proper IC to use for charging or recharging the battery. However, after discussing with members from the 477 Staff, it is equally, if not more important, to first identify the type of battery required. Thus, this required some very high-level approximations of the power required by different components. I looked primarily at the microcontroller and the LED matrix since these will have considerable current draws. In doing so, I realized the LEDs will require much more power than our team had realized and may lead us to needing an alternate method of powering the gameboards. Overall, this was crucial for our team to identify so we may address the arising constraints. Next week, our team will work together to determine which powering method will be the most convenient and effective for the user. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Next week there will be a continued emphasis on the user and gameboard interaction; I will investigate more methods of creating a safe, but electrically possible way for the boats to contain the voltage dividers. I will continue to use this time to familiarize myself with KiCad in preparation for creating the PCB layout.
