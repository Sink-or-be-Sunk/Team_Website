<h4>Overview</h4>
This week, I spent most of my time integrating embedded software written from
different team members. We have all been working on prototyping the various
subsystems of our project in separate code projects, but it is important that
these pieces start to fit together into one coherent unit. For this weeks
progress, I was able to integrate the following systems:
<ul>
  <li>Keypad Matrix</li>
  <li>OLED Display</li>
  <li>RGBW single wire control LED</li>
  <li>Wifi Provisioning</li>
  <li>Wifi Websocket Connection</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues</h4>
During the integration process, I ran into many speed bumps along the way. The
first issue came from the keypad matrix. The code that I was attempting to
integrate came from another team member so the first step was to try to
understand how it worked. The code was all located in a single main.c file where
the keys were continuously scanned in an infinite loop. This obviously isn't
something that could directly be ported to our final integration because no
other tasks would be able to run. Because of this, I started by generating an
RTOS task for the keypad. This way you can abstract away the actual timing of
the scanning to the RTOS scheduler and get the appearance of simultaneous
actions. The next issue with the keypad involved button debounce. The scanning
approach that was used by the teammates code proved to be very unpredictable in
terms of button presses. Sometimes a press wouldn't register and sometimes it
would register as multiple presses. To fix this issue, I created a new algorithm
instead of scanning in an endless loop.
<ol>
  <li>Set all row pins high</li>
  <li>all col pins are pulled low from pulldown resistor</li>
  <li>
    Attach a rising edge interrupt to the column pins that will trigger when a
    button is pressed to connect the rows to a column
  </li>
  <li>In the ISR, trigger an event to send to the RTOS scheduler</li>
  <li>RTOS scheduler accepts event and processes the key press as follows:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Set all row pins low</li>
    <li>Iterate through all row pins setting them high one at a time</li>
    <li>During each iteration check if the corresponding col pin is high</li>
    <li>
      Once the row is found which results in setting the col high you have found
      the row and column of the press
    </li>
    <li>Parse the row and column to get the corresponding button</li>
  </ol>
  <li>REPEAT</li>
</ol>

It is important to note at this point that any sort of debounce had to be
software due to the use of RTOS. Using a simple RC hardware debounce resulted in
erroneous keypress due to the slow rise time combined with analog noise.
<br />
The next main issue came from the single wire control of the LED. Originally, I
tried to use another RTOS event loop that would use task delays to achieve
necessary high and low time for the serial communication. As it turns out, the
delays allowed must be greater than or equal to 10 us. This means that the
O(10ns) times specified by the LED datasheets were unattainable. To solve this
issue, I was able to tap into the RMT subsystem of the ESP32. This system is
generally used for IR remote controls that uses a similar serial control schema
based on timings. This API allowed for setting the needed high and low times in
software, set a data payload in bytes, and then send the information to a gpio
pin.

<h4>Results</h4>
The final product of this weeks work can be seen from the video below. Notice
that there is a simple graphical interface on the OLED display to prompt the
user to perform various actions for wifi provisioning. When the user navigates
to the connect page, pressing the enter (#) key will broadcast the device to the
websocket server so that a user can connect their device to their account (more
info on this from last week). The user can also press another button on the
keypad to turn on the LED. For demonstration sake, when the LED is turned on it
cycles through all the colors in a strobe-like fashion.

  Note: testing setup is run entirely off the 1100mAhr battery shown in the
  video.
