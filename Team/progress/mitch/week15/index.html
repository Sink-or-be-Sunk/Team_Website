This week I worked on various bug fixes for the embedded software to get it to
production quality. This involved adding new features such as a new packet to
reset the state of the microcontroller when the connection is interrupted. This
allows players to have their micro completely powered off and then reconnect to
their game. Throughout the revisions in the code that I produced, I published
new releases to GitHub. This allows for anyone on the team to have the ability
to flash the code onto the ESP device even if they do not have the ability to
build the project from the source. This is important because we have had
continual issues where teammates are unable to configure the build tools on
their systems.

In addition to working on embedded, I spent a lot of time focusing on the web
interface of the gameplay. The following image shows the interface for the user
to interact with the game from their web browser. It allows the user to drag the
images of the ships to their desired locations on the game to position their
ships. In addition to being an important part of our web application.
Programming this web interface has allowed me to test the server code without
the need to work with the embedded system. This has allowed me to catch and fix
bugs that have arose from corner cases in the gameplay that I may not have
caught from testing over the ESP websocket code.
