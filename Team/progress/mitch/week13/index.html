This week was a frustrating mess of debugging the PCB. The first half of the
week was dedicated to figuring out why we were unable to flash the PCB with
firmware. From countless hours of probing, debugging, and fly-wiring, the
following flaws were discovered in our design:
<ul>
  <li>
    The USB to UART converter has a VCCIO pin that sets the logic level of the
    UART transmission. We had this pin set to 5v which fried the ESP micro which
    uses 3.3v logic. Fly-wiring was used to tie the VCCIO pin to 3.3v fixing
    this issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    The USB to UART IC RX and TX pins were tied to the RX and TX pins of the
    microcontroller. They are supposed to be cross connected so that the RX of
    one connects to the TX pin of the other allowing bidirectional
    communication. This was fixed through cutting the traces and fly-wiring
  </li>
  <li>
    After successfully checking off a PSSC where the board was able to connect
    to WIFI, the board stopped working with the flash. This issue was never
    resolved and I would speculate that the ESP on this board has some
    connection issues causing faulty resets or unexpected strapping pin signals.
    From this point, we decided to move to another board and completely bypass
    the programming circuit and move that to an external board.
  </li>
  <li>
    The external programmer auto reset circuit failed to reset the chip. This
    was fixed by manually pulling the boot and reset pins low during device
    flash.
  </li>
  <li>
    It was found that the pins that we were using for spi communication with our
    LED display were used for internally accessing the flash memory of the
    device and were not recommended for use. Because of this, the code would not
    work with these specific pins. We have a plan to move the pins around to
    allow our code to work. This will mean that we use connectors that are
    supposed to be used for another function for the LCD. This is not an ideal
    solution, but it should allow for our complete functionality of the project
    with the downside that our cabling is a bit messy.
  </li>
</ul>
