This week, I focused on two things: making final revisions our two PCBs and
continuing work on the MCU to Server communication. For the PCBs there were
revisions for both boards as follows:

<h4>PCB_ESP32</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Added Team Logo to silkscreen</li>
  <li>Added Team Signatures to the board</li>
  <li>
    Changed back copper from GND to 3v3 to help carry the current needed to
    power the LED daisy chain boards, Motor, Speaker, and Amplifier.
  </li>
  <li>Fixed JST connectors with the correct 2.54mm footprints</li>
  <li>Updated board dimensions to fit new connectors</li>
  <li>Updated Switching Regulator Footprint with the manufactures footprint</li>
  <li>Changed from using the MCP602 to LM4890 for the audio amplifier</li>
  <li>
    Changed footprint for the mounting holes to keep copper fill out of screw
    head diameter
  </li>
</ul>

<br />

<h4>PCB_Grid</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed the issue of the strobe enable not being tied to GND which would lead
    to undefined behavior for the device.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changed the Footprints of the JST connectors to match the 2.54mm parts on
    order
  </li>
  <li>Changed ESP Mux select signals to create cleaner routing</li>
  <li>
    Decreased Ground Plane clearance to allow power path to flow between Mux THT
    pins
  </li>
  <li>
    Changed mounting hole spacing to better distribute the pressure on inserting
    ship pins
  </li>
  <li>
    Changed mounting hole footprint to include keep out from the screw head
  </li>
  <li>Added wave graphic to silk screen</li>
</ul>

<h4>PCB Grid Final Render</h4>

In addition to working on the PCB, I also spend some time working on the MCU and
Server packet communication. This involved me connecting to the locally hosted
server with the ESP32 board and ensuring that the packet structure was correct
on the side of the microcontroller. Note that I have already ran the server
through many test cases that check to ensure that it behaves as expected.

<br />

While testing, I found that it was difficult to get any real world testing past
the connection to the game and positioning the ships. To be able to have a back
and forth, there needs to be an opponent. To allow for this, I created a new
endpoint on the server that allows for the user to make basic game requests.
Currently this endpoint has little input validation checks and is more for use
as a development tool as opposed to a polished user experience. Once
functionality has been completely verified (right now the create game, join
game, position ships, and attacks are all working), I can transition to making
the page have a more professional and interactive feel as a legitimate game.
