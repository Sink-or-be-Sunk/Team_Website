This week I switched gears to focus fully on helping the team to complete our
schematics/layouts for both of our boards. We have two types of board, the Grid
board and the ESP board. The later of the two (as the name suggests) holds the
microcontroller and all main circuitry including power regulation, charging, and
programming ports. Additionally, the ESP board holds many connects to the
various components of the design including the speaker, rumble motor, keypad,
and lcd.
<br />
<br />

The other board in our design is the Grid board. This is an auxiliary board
whose job is to simply house the LEDs and detect the placement of ships. This
board holds very few components. The board holds a multiplexer to route the
signals from each of the ship detection rows back to the ESP board.
Additionally, the board routes the daisy chained LED ICs.
<br />
<br />

The process of placing and routing components proved to take far more time than
expected, and thus the team needed more individuals to split the work. The
results of this can be seen below:
