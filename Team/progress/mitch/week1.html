Prior to this week, Mitch had spent much of the summer doing R&D work with the
Websocket Server. He created a project that would be the framework to be used
for this Senior Design Project. He created an express server using NodeJS using
the typescript language to help with keeping the project strongly typed. This is
important not just for the debugging and developement reasons, but also because
it would make the programming experience closer to that of C/C++ which he knew
would be more familiar with his teammates. This would allow for greater
collaboration during the semster. Once the express server was working, Mitch
added websocket endpoints to the server. A websocket allows for bidirectional
communication between a client and server without the need for polling. This is
helpful for keeping a real time communication during the gameplay where a client
will make game move requests to the server and it is expected that the opposing
player will be instantly updated with the results of this move. The websocket
ensures that this can happen. asdf.
