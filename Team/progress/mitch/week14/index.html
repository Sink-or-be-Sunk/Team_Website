This weeks progress is slightly less than average due to the Thanksgiving
Holiday shortening the week. Additionally, I left for break last Friday, meaning
my contributions were all virtual this week. The major task that I helped with
(again virtually over zoom calls) was to assist Molly with flashing new firmware
to the ESP PCB to try to remediate our issue with the pin definitions of the
board. As I stated in last week's report, I found that the pins that we had
assigned and routed on the PCB had limitations in their usage that meant we
needed to make some changes to the code in order for all the required functions
to work properly.

<br />
<br />
The first thing that I did was to lay out which pins we currently were using on
an excel document. I then went through and listed all the limitations that these
pins had, and displayed conditional formatting on the pins that definitely would
not work with our design. Again, the issues included trying to use a pin for an
output that was only a GPI pin (instead of a true GPIO pin) or trying to use a
pin that is restricted to the internal SPI flash access of the device. These
pins are not recommended by the manufacturer for use and thus we need to leave
them as no connects on the physical ESP PCB.

<br />
<br />
Following making this list, I then added a column to show which of the pins were
directly connected to pin headers/connectors on the board. This would allow us
to easily swap pins by simply changing where the connector plugs into the board.
Once I did this, I began the process of moving and swapping the pins so that in
theory every pin should be able to accommodate the required function of the pin.
The final list that I created can be seen below.

With this chart as a guide, I changed the pin definitions in the code. To help
with this, I created a new manager class that is responsible for all the pin
definitions. This way, I can go to one place to change the pins for the entire
project. The next step was to flash the code onto the device and ensure that it
worked. This is where I began to run into some issues due to my inability to be
in the lab physically. I worked with Molly to download the ESP IDF build tools
so that she could build and flash the project. During this project we
encountered many issues and ultimately we were unable to get her computer fully
set up with the tools needed to build the project.

<br />
<br />

To get around this as a temporary fix. I created releases on GitHub where I
attached a zipped version of the build directory of the code. This directory
contains all the binaries and configuration files needed to flash the device
which is generated from a project build. This way, Molly was able to download
and extract the build folder into her project and flash the device with the code
that I built on my computer. This process ended up working for the flash, but we
are still working out bugs in the actual performance of the code. Only some of
the buttons in the button matrix are working as expected and the Display is not
working. These are most likely issues with the physical wiring of the device and
is something that I will be able to help with more once I get back to campus
next week.
