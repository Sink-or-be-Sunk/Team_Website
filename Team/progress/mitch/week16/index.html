This week was focused on getting to the finish line. This involved spending long
hours in the lab working on assembly, embedded software, server software, and
integration testing. The majority of my time was spent at testing the embedded
software with the final hardware. I found many bugs in the boat detection code
that was rendering our detection useless. As this is one of our PSSCs, I
dedicated an entire day to reworking the software so that not only did I fix the
issues that were previously there, I also made the performance better and a
smoother user experience. Users are able to put in and take out ships at any
time with LED indication on the board to show where ships have been detected.

After a long semester of hard work, we finally have a final product that our
whole team can feel proud of:

To finish off the week, the team participated in the Spark Challenge to show off
our design. I was very pleased to see that our design brought smiles to many
faces and was genuinely fun to play with.
