Prior to this week, I spent much of the summer doing R&D work with the Websocket
Server. I created a project that would be the framework to be used for this
Senior Design Project. I created an express server using NodeJS using the
typescript language to help with keeping the project strongly typed. This is
important not just for the debugging and development reasons, but also because
it would make the programming experience closer to that of C/C++ which I knew
would be more familiar with his teammates. This would allow for greater
collaboration during the semester.
<br />
Once the express server was working, I added websocket endpoints to the server.
A websocket allows for bidirectional communication between a client and server
without the need for polling. This is helpful for keeping a real time
communication during the game play where a client will make game move requests
to the server and it is expected that the opposing player will be instantly
updated with the results of this move. The websocket ensures that this can
happen.
<br />
The next step was to create the game logic on the server. This logic was broken
down into object oriented chunks. The breakdown for these classes can be seen
below:

The next stage was to start planning the entire system. I knew that we would
need a WiFi module, a hosted server, a microcontroller to handle local game
player interaction logic, and any peripherals for the user experience such as
LEDs and speakers. During planning I created this schematic for envisioning the
layout:

Most of the microcontroller peripherals seemed relatively straight forward. The
speaker could be driven by the DAC, the player moves could be read from a button
matrix, the LEDs could be driver through a shift registered GPIO output. The
main drawback/complication to this project was the sensing of the ships. This
was a difficult problem because there is a large grid that needs to be monitored
(8x8). Additionally, each boat needs to be detected as unique from another boat.
It would cause many issues with the server logic if the game board wasn't able
to provide the id of a ship at a specific location. The microcontroller would
need to distinguish a battleship (four peg) boat from a submarine (three peg)
ship. To solve this issue, I came up with the idea of using resistor dividers
inside the boats to produce a unique analog voltage associated with them. The
diagram below helps to illustrate this point.

This method allows for the battleship to have a voltage of 1/5*Vdd and the
submarine could be 2/5*Vdd. The microcontroller has 16 bit resolution which
means that these kinds of intervals would be trivial to distinguish. The divider
outputs could all be run through a network of analog multiplexers to drive the
64 inputs down to 1 input for the ADC of the microcontroller.
