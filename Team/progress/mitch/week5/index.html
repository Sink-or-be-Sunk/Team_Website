This week I picked up where I left off with the device pairing. Last week I was
focused on the server side software (database, ui, etc...), but this week I
worked with the physical hardware and device firmware required for the pairing
process. This proved to be much more difficult that I originally anticipated...
<ul>
  <li>
    First, I had to find a way to get a unique identifier of the ESP32 device.
    After spending hours scrolling through the API documentation and online
    forums, I found that I can use the MAC address of the device as a device ID
    and be fairly certain of no overlap. This ID is 12 digit hex string. This
    means that there can be $$16^{12} = 2.8*10^{14}$$ unique devices. As this is
    an incredibly large number, and this is for a prototype design, we should
    have no issues with conflicting device IDs.
  </li>
  <li>
    The next issue was on a related note. I wanted to find a more user friendly
    way to id the device than a string of hex characters. The way that I wanted
    to solve this was by using the SSID of the wifi network that the device is
    connected to. This involved more searching through documentation on the
    ESP-IDF website to find the data structure that holds this information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Following this, I needed a way to have the user physically confirm the
    device pairing from the MCU side. I wanted to use a push button to trigger
    an interrupt that would then send the corresponding websocket message. This
    turned into a rabbit hole as I tried to the interrupts to work. Because the
    ESP runs on freeRTOS, nothing is a straightforward as it usually is. To get
    everything to work correctly, you first need to create and attach an ISR to
    a certain GPIO pin. This ISR needs to then generate a freeRTOS event. This
    event is then queued by the OS software and called with a high priority due
    to its generation from an ISR.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once my initial proof of concept started working, I set out to stub out an
    API that can be used to interface with the server. The way I did this was
    using C++ classes that contain function calls for a subset of server
    messages: Game Request (this involves making a move, positing ships,
    etc...), Registration Event (these are for pairing the device to a user
    account), and DB Requests (this is still in its early stages in the server
    but its purpose will be for gathering user profile information, friends
    list, etc. for display on the MCU LED screen). Each of these subsets of
    messages follow their own unique structure of json data. Because of this,
    each main function per subset will hold unique arguments for what data is
    needed in the request. For example, the Game Requests need to pass data such
    as the coordinates of a move that the user is making.
  </li>
</ul>

This image shows the process of physically pairing the device to a user's
account. NOTE that this is functional on both the hardware (ESP) side and
software(Server) side where as last week's demo was exclusively software.
