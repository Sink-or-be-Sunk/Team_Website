  NOTE: This weeks progress is significantly less than previous weeks due to
  other obligations, interviews, and exams.

This week's progress was related to the email notification system for users. The
images below show two form emails for the password reset system. In addition to
these two emails, users will also receive email notifications for game invite
requests, winning or loosing a game, new friend requests, new friend request
acceptances, welcome aboard email, etc...
<br />
<br />

The design of these email templates is intended to be uniform to associate the
Sink or be Sunk brand to our customers. This small piece helps to draw the
entire app/game hardware together into a unified product experience that matches
what you would see from a professional company.

The final task that I worked on this week was the beginning of the assembly of
the PCB_ESP32 board. Currently, I have soldered the power regulation circuitry
so that we get a clean 3.3V from the switching regulator. With this first stage
complete, we can now move forward with adding all the other components to the
board to work towards full hardware integration.
