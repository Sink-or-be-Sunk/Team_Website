This week I spent my time familiarizing myself with the ESP32 development board
and the ESP IDF wifi api. As I am largely involved with the wifi connectivity of
the device, I focused on the wifi api calls. I ran through some of the example
programs provided by ESP IDF to start. Next I began parsing these programs into
one project that contained all the features that were needed for this project.
The first challenge from wifi comes with connecting to the network. This may
seem trivial, but a user must have a method of entering the wifi ssid and
password before they can authenticate and get network/internet access. The first
attempts that I made at this included hard coding the wifi credentials into the
ESP32's firmware. Once I was able to get this working I started looking for new
methods of connecting the device. I found that ESP IDF provides an api for their
own wifi provisioning protocol through BLE. The ESP32 first connects to a master
device through bluetooth to receive the wifi password information. ESP even has
a IOS and Android app that helps with this process. Once the device is
provisioned (and stays on the same network), this step is never needed again. I
was able to test this provisioning using the testing setup shown below:

In addition to wifi provisioning for the device, I also worked on two other core
attributes to our embedded design: sending websocket data and reading analog
inputs. As can be seen from the testing setup shown above, I was able to run a
potentiometer output voltage through a buffer into the microcontroller. The
software was then able to detect the voltage level and sent GPIO outputs high or
low to produce a unique color on the tri-color LED. This testing was to get a
rough proof of concept for our ship detection method.

The websocket connection was split into two parts: JSON data formatting and the
actual websocket connection. The websocket server is written in javascript and
therefore sends and receives data using the JSON format. In order to send JSON
strings from the ESP32, I found an open source library called cJSON. This
creates a C struct that assists in generating these JSON strings on an embedded
processor. Below is a short example of how this works:

<pre><code class="text-primary">
    char *create_new_game_req(void)
        {
        char *string = NULL; //point to output (built) string
        cJSON *id = NULL;
        cJSON *req = NULL;

        cJSON *obj = cJSON_CreateObject();
        if (obj == NULL)
        {
            goto end;
        }

        id = cJSON_CreateString("PLAYER ID");
        if (id == NULL)
        {
            goto end;
        }
        /* after creation was successful, immediately add it to the obj,
        * thereby transferring ownership of the pointer to it */
        cJSON_AddItemToObject(obj, "id", id);

        req = cJSON_CreateString("NEW GAME");
        if (req == NULL)
        {
            goto end;
        }
        cJSON_AddItemToObject(obj, "req", req);

        string = cJSON_Print(obj);
        if (string == NULL)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Failed to print obj.\n");
        }

        end:
        cJSON_Delete(obj);
        return string;
    }
</code></pre>
