Building off the server code from last week. I set out to deploy the server to a
public domain this week. I used a free hosting platform called Heroku to achieve
this. I also set up GitHub integrations to create a CI/CD (Continuous
Integration / Continuous Deployment). This means that whenever code is pushed up
to the GitHub repository, it will check the code against a set of test cases
that I wrote to ensure that no features were broken in the latest commit.
<br />
Additionally, I set up continuous deployment with Heroku. This means that
whenever the main branch of the GitHub repository is changed/pushed, the new
code will be pushed to Heroku's servers to deploy the new app. This means that
to change the code that is hosted on the public server, I simply have to perform
a git push from my machine. The hosted site can be found at
<a href="http://sink-or-be-sunk.herokuapp.com/">Sink or be Sunk</a>. NOTE:
please don't make an account at this point as the user profile database code is
still being updated and would therefore create an invalid profile. Basically by
not making an account you are saving me from going in a manually deleting your
account from the database in the future. A preview of the of the server pages
can be seen here:

Some features to the site this week all revolve around the new backend database
for the site that will hold the user information needed for linking up your
account to the game console board. These integrations include adding the
database itself (this is a mongo db document database) and adding a mail client
for the Contact page as well as password recovery, (see images below)
