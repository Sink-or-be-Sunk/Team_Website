This week I spent many hours getting the microcontroller communication with the
server all working. The difficult part was not the message passing or the
websocket, but rather the architecture of the entire embedded system in general.
I decided to split all main functional units into separate C++ classes to keep
things organized. This way I would have classes such as WifiManager,
ButtonManager, ScreenManager, etc...
<br />

The main effort was getting the ScreenManager class completely fleshed out. The
ScreeManager is in charge of keeping the state of the menus for the Character
Display. The screen needs to update for any game events received through the
websocket as well as it needs to respond to any user interaction with the
buttons. This level of interconnection between classes, such as between the
websocket class, the button manager, the websocket message builder class, and so
on led to growing complexity; however, this structure also made finding bugs
very easy.

Note that this demonstration shows the user scrolling through the friends list
which requires the microcontroller to send a request for a user's list of
friends that is stored in the database. The server sends back the list and the
micro renders out the screen with this information.
<br />
<br />
After the weeks work, the user is able to play an entire game by creating or
joining a game, positioning their ships (this is hard coded right now), and then
sending and receiving attacks from another player from the web game console
interface. Below is an image of the attack screen.
