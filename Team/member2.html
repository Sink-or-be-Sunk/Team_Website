	I am a senior in Computer Engineering with a minor in Military Science and Leadership for Purdue Army ROTC. My focus is primarily software with embedded design, high-level languages, and code development. I enjoy snowboarding in the winter in Michigan, powerlifting, and playing the occasional adult-league hockey game. My free time also includes playing chess with friends and online.
