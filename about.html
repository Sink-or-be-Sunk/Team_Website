<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
The goal of this project is to create the most engaging and socially distanced
version of Battleship, our team has conceptualized a variety of ways to enhance
the game experience while keeping its integrity. The first obstacle is to
maintain social distancing. Our team plans to implement a connection between two
battery-powered boards via WIFI from the ESP32 and web sockets, allowing for
optimal and adjustable distancing. We will use a server to host the code for the
gameplay logic, which validates legal plays on both boards. To reinvigorate
gameplay, our team will engage with the players through touch, sight, and sound.
Players will firmly place or lock-in, their boats on the boards at the beginning
of the game and place pegs into their opponent’s board to simulate missiles or
torpedoes (depending on gameplay selection). For each “attack”, LEDs
corresponding to hits or misses will flash on both players’ boards, creating a
stronger visual appeal. When a boat is decimated, each setup will vibrate and
audibly announce which boat has sunk, which will not only keep players
interested but reproduce the incentive to win. Finally, to put a spin on the
traditional playing style, we will create a variety of game modes. These
different modes will allow players to play casually or competitively, quickly,
or for longevity. The various play options will further player interest simply
by allowing the players to play towards an objective of their choice.
