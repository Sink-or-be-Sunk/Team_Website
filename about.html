<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
<div class="justify">
  The goal of this project is to create the most engaging and socially distanced
  version of Battleship, and our team has conceptualized a variety of ways to
  enhance the game experience while keeping its integrity. The first obstacle is
  to maintain social distancing. Our team plans to implement a connection
  between two battery-powered boards via WiFi from the ESP32 and web sockets,
  allowing for optimal and adjustable distancing. We will use a server to host
  the code for the gameplay logic, which validates legal plays on both boards.
  To reinvigorate gameplay, our team will engage with the players through touch,
  sight, and sound. Players will firmly place or lock-in, their boats on the
  boards at the beginning of the game and enter coordinates on a key pad to 
  determine the attack location (depending on gameplay selection). For each
  “attack”, LEDs corresponding to hits or misses will flash on both players’
  boards, creating a stronger visual appeal. When a boat is decimated, each
  setup will vibrate and audibly announce which boat has sunk, which will not
  only keep players interested but reproduce the incentive to win. Finally, to
  put a spin on the traditional playing style, we will create a variety of game
  modes. These different modes will allow players to play casually or
  competitively, quickly or for longevity. The various play options will
  further player interest simply by allowing the players to play towards an
  objective of their choice.
